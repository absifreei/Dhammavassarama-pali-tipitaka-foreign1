                  — A Manual on Cows and Intoxicants.” It deals with the evils 
                  of gambling, horse-racing, and intoxicants. The section on 
                  meat-eating and the mistreatment of cows has been published

                  size=-1>Intoxication is a serious social evil. The fifth 
                  Buddhist precept enjoins us to “abstain from intoxicants, 
                  which cause heedlessness.” Heedlessness <I>(pamāda)</I> is a 
                  euphemism for intoxication and sensual indulgence. The Buddha 
                  said that while he was a young man he gave up all 
                  intoxication: “On seeing an old man, all intoxication with 
                  youth vanished from me. On seeing a sick man, all intoxication 
                  with health vanished from me. On seeing a dead man, all 
                  intoxication with life vanished from me.” Even without 
                  intoxicants, most people are intoxicated with sensual 
                  pleasures, youth, health, or life, and it is hard for them to 
                  realise how they are trapped by death.</FONT> </P>

                  size=-1>In the Noble One’s discipline, dancing is likened to 
                  madness, singing to lamentation, and laughter to childishness. 
                  The excitement prevalent at many sports events is also a kind 
                  of intoxication. Would anyone chase a ball around or watch 
                  others do it, if not intoxicated in some way? Most sports do 
                  not involve evil kamma, but would it not be wiser to redirect 
                  those efforts to charity work?</FONT> </P>

                  face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif 
                  size=-1>Evil kamma is made whenever one supports and 
                  encourages the evil deeds of others. Fox-hunting, fishing, 
                  horse-racing, boxing, etc., all encourage violence of one kind 
                  or another. Football, rugby, ice-hockey, and other contact 
                  sports also involve incidental violence and injury, but that 
                  is not their aim, so one will not make evil kamma unless one 
                  approves of violent tactics contrary to the spirit of fair 
                  play. Racing with vehicles does not intentionally inflict 
                  suffering on animals, but it does involve a kind of madness 
                  that is remote from nibbāna.</FONT></P>

                  size=-1>Gambling is motivated by greed and discontent, which 
                  means unwholesome kamma. Whatever one can earn by honest 
                  labour should be used to provide for one’s family or to 
                  practise charity. By living within one’s means, one will keep 
                  out of debt.</FONT></P>

                  size=-1>To dwell on the evil consequences of intoxicants is 
                  barely necessary, for they are well known. How much better 
                  would society be if we campaigned against alcohol consumption 
                  as much as we do against smoking? Instead of talking about 
                  legalising the use of marijuana, we should be teaching the 
                  next generation that alcohol consumption is socially 
                  unacceptable. How many riots, assaults, and accidents have 
                  been fuelled by alcohol? What would the cost savings be to the 
                  NHS if we could reduce alcohol consumption by half? How many 
                  hours of police time are wasted on incidents involving 
                  football louts, midnight revelers, and drunken drivers? What 
                  is the financial and social cost of drug abuse? How many 
                  working hours are lost due to hangovers?</FONT> </P>

                  Sayādaw points out, one makes bad kamma in four ways: doing it 
                  oneself, urging others to do it, approving of it, or speaking 
                  in praise of it. Cruel sports such as fox-hunting, 
                  bull-fighting, and game-shooting are totally unacceptable to 
                  Buddhists. They should all be made illegal, since they involve 
                  gross and needless cruelty to animals. </FONT></P>

                  size=-1>Horse-racing is less cruel, but it should be more 
                  strictly regulated to reduce injury and cruelty. Whips could 
                  be banned, and the height of fences could be reduced, to 
                  reduce the danger to the horses. Wild horses run flat-out only 
                  to avoid death from predators.</FONT></P>

                  condone violence. Most Buddhists would regard such sports as 
                  coarse and uncivilised. Sumo wrestling, Kendo, T'ai Chi Chuan, 
                  and Judo are more civilised combat sports that originated in 
                  Buddhist countries. Martial arts for self-defence can teach 
                  youngsters how to curb and channel their aggression, without 
                  encouraging violence.</FONT></P>

                  unwholesome kamma for those involved in producing it, and for 
                  those who enjoy watching it. The portrayal of immorality, sex, 
                  and violence can undoubtedly be a bad influence, and we humans 
                  are much more impressionable than we will ever admit. If we

                  students of psychology — intelligent young adults whom one 
                  might expect would not be too impressionable.</FONT></P>

                  size=-1>All the students except the ‘guinea pigs’ being tested 
                  by the experiment were secretly told to speak the truth at 
                  first, but later to lie, when asked which of a series of lines 
                  drawn on a card shown by the tester was longest. The camera 
                  recording the experiment showed that the ‘guinea pigs’ at 
                  first answered truthfully, but became increasingly embarrassed 
                  when their answers conflicted with the rest of the group, and 
                  later lied to avoid being the ‘odd-man-out.’ This clearly 
                  proves that intelligent people can easily be coerced into 
                  doing what is immoral, stupid, or wrong, simply by exerting a 
                  little peer pressure. Commercial pressures, subversive 
                  literature, political ‘spin’, and media ‘hype’ have conspired 
                  to undermine spiritual values in the modern world. </FONT></P>

                  impossible, not only in the west, but also in Buddhist

                  notions formed by innate delusion, and reinforced by cultural

                  consequences in the present life. This means suffering in hell 
                  and long term bad effects in the present life. So the effect 
                  of taking intoxicants or drugs is quite serious as it leads to 
                  the four states of misery: hell, animals, ghosts, and demons. 
                  The present evil effect, among others, is at least becoming

                  size=-1>Why do intoxicants cause rebirth in hell in future 
                  lives? The reason is that drinking alcohol and taking drugs 
                  promotes fresh evil kamma. Evil kamma leads to hell. Moreover, 
                  by these evil deeds, the door of opportunity is open for past 
                  evil kammas to give appropriate effects. Thus one suffers in 
                  hell. Please note that everyone has done evil deeds in their 
                  previous existences so, at present, good deeds should be 
                  done.</FONT></P>

                  size=-1>Taking intoxicants and non-medicinal drugs means 
                  making fresh evil kamma because it promotes greed, hatred, and 
                  delusion. It also supports wrong views, which urge one to do 
                  new evil kammas. It sustains and develops the five hindrances 
                  such as lust, anger, dullness, restlessness, and doubt. 
                  Intoxicants damage genes and chromosomes. They also burn the 
                  mind and consciousness. So taking intoxicants affects the 
                  mental realm, which has profound significance. Evil bodily and 
                  vocal acts follow as a result of drunkenness. Killing, lying, 
                  abusing, etc., are the usual results of taking 
                  alcohol.</FONT></P>

                  misdeeds, which are the ten evil kammas. So taking alcohol 
                  increases daily the burden of future suffering in hell, and 
                  the burden of evil and guilt. There is little doubt that a 
                  drunkard will be reborn in one of the lower realms when he 
                  dies, since he accumulates evil kamma every day. He is 
                  demented in the present life. For countless lives he does 
                  other serious unwholesome kamma. So with counteractive kamma 
                  of this type, when he dies, he suffers in the lower realms. 
                  His burden of evil kamma is heavy. His misbehaviour is 
                  serious. So fresh evil deeds appear.</FONT></P>

                  size=-1>In past lives one has already done many kinds of evils 
                  while wandering in the rounds of existence, as one seldom 
                  hears the true Dhamma. These precious chances are very rare. 
                  Meeting Noble Ones is very rare, possible only once in a 
                  thousand or ten thousand existences. In past lives one did 
                  various evils and misdeeds in thought, speech, and deed. Lives 
                  of crime, guilt, and evil lead to the realms of suffering. The 
                  likelihood of this result is increased by drinking alcohol. 
                  The breaking of this moral precept means supporting other past 
                  evil deeds that one has already done. Past evil deeds resemble 
                  robbers and murderers who stay near a village to commit 
                  crimes. Transgression of this precept gives impetus to evil 
                  deeds: past, present, or future. So the evil kamma of taking 
                  alcohol resembles receivers of stolen goods who live in the 
                  village. Robbers get their chance due to the receivers of 
                  stolen goods. Villages are destroyed by them.</FONT></P>

                  size=-1>Likewise, as long as the evil of taking intoxicants 
                  remains, there will be chances for the previous evil deeds to 
                  mature. People have to take rebirth in various hells when past 
                  misdeeds mature. Everyone has also done some good deeds in 
                  their past lives, but these good deeds have no chance to 
                  mature due to the present evil kamma. If one dies without 
                  abandoning this evil, one will not escape from the results of 
                  the past evil kamma. Certainly one will suffer in hell. In 
                  this sense, drinking alcohol certainly brings about hell in 
                  the next life. Because serious past evil kamma take their 
                  chance, one reaches Roruva hell. In Roruva are two hells: 
                  Jalaroruva hell and Dhumaroruva hell.</FONT></P>

                  dangers with foresight, have to rely on almsgiving, observance 
                  of moral precepts, and mental discipline. For what benefits? 
                  In this era, five Buddhas teach the true Dhamma. Four Buddhas 
                  have already appeared. In the future, Metteyya Buddha will be 
                  the last to attain supreme wisdom and teach the Dhamma. After 
                  that there will be many eras without any Buddhas or their 
                  teaching. To pay respects to the coming Metteyya in this world 
                  and gain the path, its fruition, and nibbana, everyone should 
                  perform charitable deeds, observe moral precepts, and practise 
                  meditation. These good supportive kammas will result in seeing 
                  Metteyya Buddha. After Metteyya Buddha’s era, the world will 
                  be engulfed in a long era of darkness when no true teaching is

                  not be able to see Metteyya Buddha.</FONT></P>

                  madness and phobia. They destroy the healthy state of mind. 
                  They give false peace to some extent, but their side-effects 
                  do serious harm to the mind and body. Addicts’ bodies are full 
                  of toxins, and deteriorate physically. Mentally, the effects 
                  of drugs make the mind vulnerable to evil forces. The mind is 
                  clouded by drugs, so it inclines toward sensual pleasures and 
                  wrong views.</FONT></P>

                  fail to get them, their minds yearn for more. Their befuddled 
                  minds long for these poisons. Even if alcoholics and drug 
                  addicts perform some meritorious deeds, they cannot attain 
                  pure deeds and pure results because of their weak minds. Even 
                  past good deeds become weak and their effects diminish.

                  good deeds done previously cannot enter the mind process.

                  prevents good rebirths in human and divine worlds. This evil

                  alcohol, even though they call themselves Buddhists, wander on 
                  in a series of low existences due to the inexorable Law of

                  the Abhidhammatthasangaha. One should discuss the contents, 
                  factors, and meaning of this brief Abhidhamma Manual. If you 
                  find it hard to memorise the entire book, at least the first 
                  three chapters must be recited daily. Those who can, should 
                  memorise the sixth to eighth chapters. Everyone should be able 
                  to memorise the Summary of Conditional Relations (Paccaya 
                  Niddesa Pāli) so that the power of Conditional Relations 
                  overwhelms the body and mind for the attainment of good. The 
                  purpose is to get concentration and purity of conduct, purging 
                  alcohol and drugs in the noble endeavour.</FONT></P>

                  because past bad deeds (taking drinks and drugs) will be 
                  erased and purified completely by the power of the 
                  Abhidhammatthasangaha or Conditional Relations. The mind is 
                  permeated with the sublime and potent Abhidhamma recitations 
                  and reflections. Unwholesome states are totally eradicated 
                  through concentrated effort and recitation of the Dhamma, just 
                  as water purifies dirt. Why is it is so effective and potent? 
                  The transgression of the precepts by taking alcohol and drugs 
                  is not a basic evil leading to hell. It is just a secondary 
                  evil, a misdeed that allows other evils to occur. Because it 
                  is just a supportive bad kamma, not a basic evil leading to 
                  rebirth in the lower realms, it can be expunged by wholesome 
                  deeds. One is able to escape fairly easily from the future 
                  consequences and present suffering of this evil 
                  deed.</FONT></P>

                    This victim is receiving the due result of his kamma. In the 
                    past existence he drove draught animals without mercy. He
