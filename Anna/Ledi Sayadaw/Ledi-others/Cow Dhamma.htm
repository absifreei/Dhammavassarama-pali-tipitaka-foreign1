                  size=-1>This unique work by the late Venerable Ledi Sayādaw 
                  puts a strong case for vegetarianism, though the Sayādaw 
                  points out that the Buddha did not prohibit the eating of meat 
                  by monks. Had the Buddha done this, as Devadatta demanded, it 
                  would have caused an obstruction to the propagation of 
                  Buddhism wherever meat-eating was common. The overriding 
                  consideration for a monk is gratitude and contentment — so if 
                  people offer meat or fish he should accept it graciously. He 
                  need not eat it, if he does not wish to. If he eats it, 
                  reflecting wisely, he will be free from blame.</FONT></P>
                  <P align=justify><FONT 
                  face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif 
                  size=-1>The Sayādaw stresses that ingratitude is the really 
                  harmful factor in eating meat. Beef-eating is especially 
                  blameworthy because cattle provide both labour and milk for 
                  mankind. Cattle are seldom used as draught animals in the 
                  West, but the practice is still common in Asia. Nevertheless, 
                  we do use a lot of dairy products, so the factor of gratitude 
                  is important here too. </FONT></P>
                  <P align=justify><FONT 
                  face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif 
                  size=-1>During the time of the Buddha, the large scale trade 
                  in meat would not have been feasible without modern transport 
                  and refrigeration. Modern technology has given man 
                  unprecedented power over nature, and the consequent growth of 
                  ingratitude towards animals, trees, the environment, and 
                  material things is obvious. The recent BSE crisis was a stark 
                  reminder of the evil nature of the modern beef-trade. There is 
                  no trace of humanity in a system that can feed animal remains 
                  to cattle just to increase their body weight for 
                  slaughter.</FONT></P>
                  <P align=justify><FONT 
                  face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif 
                  size=-1>If the Buddhadhamma is rightly understood and 
                  practised, people will surely become much more sensitive to 
                  the effect that they have on other living beings, and on their 
                  environment. The Buddha praised restraint and moderation in 
                  all things. He taught his disciples to take proper care of 
                  their bowl and robes, to eat almsfood respectfully, to clean 
                  and repair their dwellings, and not to damage trees or 
                  plants.</FONT></P>

                  size=-1>A Buddhist monastery or a Buddhist’s home should be a 
                  shrine to simplicity, cleanliness, beauty, serenity, harmony, 
                  thrift, and self-discipline. Though meat or fish may be taken 
                  in moderation, alcohol has no place in the home of a Buddhist. 
                  The Āmagandha Sutta, also from the Suttanipāta, makes it clear 
                  that unwholesome kamma is stench, and not the eating of meat. 
                  However, monks have not reflected properly on their almsfood 
                  if they look down on vegetarian meals as inferior.</FONT></P>

                  age. Perhaps we should outlaw the killing of cows as well as 
                  the hunting of foxes. It might make for a more caring 
                  society.</FONT></P></TD></TR>

                    size=-1>The Sarabhanga Jātaka. Everybody is expected to 
                    observe the five moral precepts (not to kill sentient 
                    beings, not to steal, not to commit adultery, not to lie, 
                    not to take intoxicants and drugs). Every bhikkhu must 
                    observe 227 Vinaya rules scrupulously. All Buddhists, by 
                    this observance of morality, become pure in body and speech, 
                    which is the main function of morality. One becomes a moral 
                    person by leading a moral life.<BR><BR>The characteristic of 
                    wisdom is the ability to teach others in accordance with the 
                    Dhamma as taught by the Buddha. The aim of teaching Dhamma 
                    is to develop civility, knowledge, understanding, and 
                    wisdom. He who obtains this qualification is called a wise 
                    man <I>(pandita)</I>. A wise man, who is learned in the 
                    texts and able to teach others, obtains wisdom — a necessary 
                    factor of a good man.<BR><BR>The characteristics of a good 
                    man <I>(sappurisa)</I> include the open acknowledgment of 
                    gratitude owed to others, and revering the good qualities of 
                    others. This qualification makes one a good person. Besides 
                    these two fundamental qualifications, a third one is the 
                    need for a soft and gentle mind, or a good heart. These are 
                    the basic qualities of a good man. <BR><BR>In the teaching 
                    of the Buddha, the Vinaya concerns morality, the Abhidhamma 
                    pertains to wisdom, and the Suttanta concerns the qualities 
                    of a good person <I>(sappurisa)</I>. Thus we can classify 
                    three basic aspects of life. However, they may not be 
                    coexistent as one would wish them to be. Some individuals 
                    may possess morality, but they may lack wisdom and goodness. 
                    So they may not be wise persons or good persons. Some 
                    persons are wise, but because they lack morality, they are 
                    not good. Others are good, but they may lack morality and 
                    wisdom. Some possess both morality and wisdom, but they are 
                    not good-natured. Some persons are blessed with morality and 
                    goodness, but they lack wisdom. Others possess wisdom and 
                    goodness, but they do not have morality. <BR><BR>Some people 
                    possess all three basic qualifications: morality, wisdom, 
                    and goodness. A few individuals lack all three good 
                    qualities. Those who possess all three good qualites are 
                    very rare.<BR>&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>

                    shelter and sleep under a tree must not break its branches 
                    with bad intention. For the tree becomes his best friend, a 
                    helper deserving gratitude. If one destroys the branches of 
                    the tree, one violates the duty of friendship, harming one’s 
                    benefactor. One lacks the basic requirement of a good man. 
                    This is the teaching of the Buddha in the Temiya 
                    Jātaka.<BR><BR>Breaking branches and felling trees, even 
                    with an evil, ungrateful mind, is not the evil deed of 
                    killing, because trees are not sentient beings. However, the 
                    evil mental state of ingratitude prevails. Hence the 
                    transgressor commits an evil deed. To maintain the virtues 
                    of a good person, gratitude must be shown even to lifeless 
                    things. One must show reverence and respect even to trees, 
                    which gives rest, protection, etc. The maintenance of 
                    gratitude for all living beings, and even for lifeless 
                    things, is too important to ignore. A tree should not be 
                    regarded as inferior, because ingratitude is always a 
                    serious defect in the eyes of a good person. One must always 
                    maintain gratitude because ingratitude means to adopt a 
                    wicked person’s attitude. As regards living beings, even 
                    more regard must be given to the acknowledgement of 
                    gratitude.<BR>&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>

                  However, a low class person’s gift or service usually remain

                  pounds benefit is mentioned as only one pound. This is the 
                  attitude of wicked or cunning people. They are not good 
                  Buddhists. All sincere persons of good-will acknowledge their

                  well-known persons is a hundredfold whereas that of ordinary

                  of gratitude due to one’s father and mother, one should be 
                  able to declare the same thing regarding cows. The debt one 
                  owes to them is obvious. So the Pali text states, “Cows and

                  with the labour of cows and buffaloes. So one can say that 
                  half of the wealth derived from the land belongs to animals. 
                  If a single field produces one hundred baskets of paddy, half 
                  of this is owed to animals. If a person earns one pound by 
                  fast conveyance, half of this is the property of the oxen. 
                  Therefore owners must feed their animals properly and treat 
                  them kindly. They must use the labour of animals only after 
                  treating them with due consideration. They must treat them as 
                  if they are their friends, brothers, or sons. In short, in 
                  earning a livelihood, love and kindness must prevail so that 
                  the half-share due to them can be used by the owners 
                  themselves. Otherwise owners do not have the right to use 
                  their own half of the money earned. When old, animals must be 
                  left in peace and rest so that their debts to man are repaid. 
                  They must be properly fed in old age.</FONT></P>

                  slaughtered — over three million in ten years. In the whole

                  refrain from eating meat. For the monks, if they have not 
                  seen, heard, or suspected that the meat was killed for them, 
                  they can eat it. They are free from any offence. However, mere 
                  freedom from offence does not make a good monk. The essential 
                  factors of a good monk must be observed. The vinaya rules do 
                  not forbid meat or beef as long as the above three factors are 
                  absent. However, the vinaya rules only govern impurities of 
                  the bodily and vocal spheres. They concern only one of the 
                  four types of purification. A bhikkhu also has to follow the 
                  remaining three Pārisuddhi Sīla. As these three — controlling 
                  the senses, purity of livelihood, and reflection on the use of 
                  requisites — belong to the Sutta Dhamma, a monk should conform 
                  to it so that all four purities are attained.</FONT></P>

                  bhikkhu, when he observes all four purities, attains only the

                  mind with a liberal spirit such as appreciation and 
                  acknowledgement of gratitude. This enrichment of the mind or 
                  mental sphere ensures that a good heart emerges along with 
                  good conduct. Many individuals lack this mental factor 
                  although they possess morality. The qualities of a good person

                  a monk is well-versed in vinaya and observes the discipline, 
                  he is classified as a moral monk. Yet he may be of rough mind, 
                  full of pride, stubborn, rebellious against his teachers, 
                  giving no support to the needy and no help to his elderly 
                  parents. He is always scolding and complaining. Jealousy and 
                  envy prevail in his heart. He exhibits egoism and conceit, 
                  wallowing in fame and wealth.</FONT></P>

                  size=-1>From his practice of the Pātimokkha Sīla, he is a 
                  moral person in this respect. However, he is very far from the 
                  basic characteristics of goodness as mentioned in the Metta 
                  Sutta (the fifteen points of becoming a good person). So, 
                  though moral, he is not good. Those types of monks, learned in 
                  the scriptures but proud and conceited, can only be called 
                  learned bhikkhus. However, they are not good in the sense

                  size=-1>This standard can also be applied to the laity. Those 
                  laymen who observe five precepts can only be classified as 
                  moral persons. For example, they observe the ‘non-killing’ 
                  precept by refraining from killing sentient beings, not having 
                  any intention to kill. Although by his acts some insects, 
                  pests, and other animals may suffer death, he escapes from the 
                  transgression of this precept as his intention is based on 
                  ‘non-killing’. There is in this case, no evil deed even though 
                  death occurs to pests and animals. With other intentions he 
                  perpetrates a deed that involves death to others, such as 
                  clearing fields, burning rubbish and groves. By so doing small 
                  pests are killed, but his aim is to clear the jungle or 
                  overgrowth, so he escapes evil in this act. He burns the 
                  fields, causing death to some sentient beings, but having a 
                  different intention, he escapes the evil of killing. Although 
                  thousands of insects may die, he has no responsibility for 
                  their death as his aim is to clear the fields or rubbish. It 
                  is right. He does not violate the first precept. He is still a 
                  moral person, because he has no intention to kill. However, if 
                  he knows that burning his fields or groves entails death to 
                  small animals, if he does this, he lacks love and compassion. 
                  So he is not a good person.</FONT></P>

                  they neglect to support their parents. They fail to pay 
                  respect to them. They scold learned men. They decide cases in 
                  a partial way. They oppress their inferiors. As they keep five 
                  precepts they are called “moral.” However, since they lack 
                  gratitude, humility, dutiful conduct, etc., they are not good 
                  persons at all. They lack the important factors of love and

                  without seeing the act of killing, without suspicion or

                  meat-eaters, although they know that cows are killed for food 
                  and that butchers prosper with the increasing demand, do not 
                  break the five precepts. It is just like the persons who, 
                  wishing to clear the jungle, burn bushes, trees, and groves, 
                  killing insects and animals in the process. Since they have no

                  The deed of eating is not a profound act. What is significant 
                  though, with grave consequences, is the financial help given 
                  to the slaughter-houses and meat-suppliers. The suppliers can 
                  maintain their businesses due to the purchasing power of the 
                  meat-eaters. Butchers kill more and more animals to meet the

                  size=-1>The above case resembles the case of a moral farmer, 
                  who supports five people and who burns the fields and groves, 
                  thereby killing thousands of pests and animals. One is 
                  ethical, but at the same time one is not good. Even monks who 
                  try to observe the vinaya rules gain purity of body and speech 
                  only. They must observe the vinaya rules since the Buddha 
                  alone is competent to promulgate them. The vinaya rules are 
                  issued from the Buddha’s authority, that is the power of 
                  command. Monks breaking the vinaya rules incur the guilt known 
                  as rebellion against the Buddha’s command (navitikkamma). This 
                  danger is always present. So when the Buddha allows meat with 
                  the three-fold purity to be taken by the monks, the monks have 
                  to obey. Moreover, the monks have to beg for food, relying on 
                  the help of the laity. They cannot refuse what has been

                  the Mangala Dhamma (the thirty-eight blessings). When these 
                  Mangala Dhammas are known and understood, craving for meat, 
                  such as beef, etc., will diminish in due course. Everyone 
                  should try to avoid eating the flesh of animals, especially 
                  that of cows and buffalos. One should study the Sutta Nipata, 
                  Temiya Jataka, and Narada Jataka in which the importance of 
                  gratitude is taught by the Buddha, even towards trees and 
                  animals, so that this moral precept is not violated by wrong 
                  view. Magnanimity must prevail in the world. Indebtedness must 
                  be seen everywhere.</FONT></P>

                  showing them no civility. It is remarkable that meat-eaters do 
                  not show gratitude even though they eat the flesh of animals. 
                  Yet animals show love and gratitude to human-beings. They do 
                  not receive kindness and gratitude in return, even though they 
                  serve the people. Human-beings do not show much

                  three virtues are often absent among the people. Buddhists 
                  should display these three factors of goodness. Those who live

                  praise of gratitude received from high-class persons, though 
                  the amount is small. They exaggerate the facts to honour 
                  people in high positions in an ingratiating way. The 
                  high-ranking person is praised out of all proportion. A

                  received. A thousand pounds worth of benefit is reduced to 
                  only twenty-five. Sometimes they totally ignore the help 
                  received from others. If their benefactors lack position, 
                  power, wealth, etc., they show even less gratitude. They 
                  dismiss the debt of gratitude that is due, concealing the 
                  benefit received. They do not help their benefactors when they 
                  are in need. They now shun them. They are glad when their 
                  benefactor dies because they do not want to repay their debt.

                  size=-1>So the gratitude owed to animals is often denied. One 
                  seldom reflects on or acknowledges one’s debts to animals, not 
                  even to the smallest extent. As cows have no status, being 
                  dumb animals, people neglect to show any gratitude. The virtue 
                  of gratitude therefore diminishes, promoting vanity and folly 
                  among mankind, and callousness spreads. People become partial 
                  towards the upper class and biased against those of lower 
                  class. Dignified persons receive undeserved praise and 
                  exaggerated gratitude, while low-class benefactors are 
                  belittled, or totally ignored. Because it imparts 
                  righteousness, the importance of gratitude even towards trees 
                  was taught by the Buddha. The Pali text “Yassa rukkhassa 
                  sayara” teaches us to preserve gratitude even for non-sentient 
                  things like trees. People should not destroy trees as they 
                  enjoy shelter under them. People should not say unkind words. 
                  This is the teachings of the bodhisattas and the Buddhas. They 
                  habitually practise this virtue.</FONT></P>

                  size=-1>Among the various good deeds deserving gratitude, the 
                  giving of sustenance ranks in the highest class. So man owes 
                  gratitude to cows in the same way as to parents. Cows are like 
                  our fathers and mothers. It is very strange that man, having 
                  enjoyed the services of animals at will, still delights in 
                  eating their flesh. Old cows are killed or sent to 
                  slaughter-houses. The gratitude that is prevalent among 
                  animals is absent among mankind. People lack genuine faith, 
                  and hold wrong views to the fullest extent. It is hard to 
                  realise the truth of gratitude. Seeing meat-eaters, one can 
                  know their lack of loving-kindness and compassion. Lacking 
                  loving-kindness and compassion, they discard also a sense of 
                  gratitude, a fundamental characteristic to become a good 
                  person.</FONT></P>

                  follow in its wake. Seeing meat, one will see the flesh of 
                  ones’ own parents. Cows’ flesh is comparable to the flesh of 
                  one’s own brothers and sisters, sons and daughters. Visions of 
                  one’s parents will appear in the mind. So instead of eating, 
                  one will certainly cry. One will not touch beef. Since past 
                  thankfulness reappear now. This is the way of a good person’s 
                  heart and conduct.</FONT></P>

                  animals, and then eat their flesh, the honour and dignity of 
                  animals is reduced to the lowest order. Although man owes 
                  limitless gratitude to cows, not the least acknowledgement 
                  appears. Man’s lust for eating meat overwhelms all gratitude. 
                  When one remembers how the Buddha honoured the Tree of 
                  Enlightenment for seven days by showing his gratitude, such 
                  behaviour towards cows becomes incomprehensible. The depth of 
                  folly is unfathomable, if ingratitude reigns 
                  supreme.</FONT></P>

                  justifies the means. They have a selfish outlook, and only 
                  pragmatic considerations of usefulness or benefit prevail. 
                  Meat-eaters also belong to this group. The Buddha’s teaching 
                  is based on love and compassion, which are the outcome of 
                  gratitude. It cannot discard the outlook and behaviour of 
                  indebtedness. The right attitude must not be lost. Everyone 
                  should consider the service rendered by cows. The next 
                  consideration must be based on the following thought: “If cows 
                  were high-status persons or honourable, how one’s gratitude 
                  would multiply! Though they derive great service and milk from 
                  them, people do not rate them highly, let alone speaking in 
                  praise of cows. If only cows had rank and 
position!”</FONT></P>

                  the gratitude due to them. People would show love and kindness 
                  to the fullest extent. Torture and killing of cows would not 
                  be allowed. Even the sight of their flesh would arouse pity. 
                  Considering thus, much gratitude will be heaped on them with 
                  love and compassion. With this strong pure mind the teaching 
                  of “Yassa rukkhassa sayara” will be implemented. Hence the 
                  factor of a good person is realised.</FONT></P>

                  size=-1>Lust for food compels some to eat even dogs and crows. 
                  At first, no one wishes to eat crows, since they are regarded 
                  as unclean. Dogs eat dirty things. Yet one enjoys pork, 
                  chicken, etc., though pigs and chickens eat bad things too. 
                  Without familiarity, no one will eat human flesh, but once 
                  people started, it would become a daily dish. Soon after a 
                  child is born, parents feed it beef, chicken, etc., so people 
                  enjoy meat, instead of loathing it. Similarly, if there were 
                  such a custom, people would eat their own father and mother 
                  with relish, or they would enjoy the flesh of their own sons 
                  and daughters. Once any food becomes familiar, even the flesh 
                  of dogs becomes tasty. The power of lust has no limits. Lust 
                  for food, like lust for sensual pleasures, continually wants 
                  to try new dishes. Man can become as lustful as a dog. The 
                  unrestrained carnal lust for sex and food is obvious in 
                  animals. The root cause is lust, with no special distinction 
                  between men and animals. So by reflecting on gratitude, one 
                  should avoid eating the flesh of cows and buffalos.</FONT></P>

                  pita bhata, aññe vapi ca ñataka.” The meaning is that cows and 
                  buffalos, being providers of rice and other food, are givers 
                  of life. They are comparable to one’s mother and father. If 
                  people can eat their parents’ flesh, they will also eat meat. 
                  If they will not eat their parents flesh, they should refrain 
                  from eating meat. If one heard that a man had eaten his 
                  parents, he would be regarded as an inhuman monster, maniac, 
                  or cannibal. Similarly, on hearing that people eat the flesh 
                  of cows and buffalos, one can judge that they are monsters, 
                  maniacs, or barbarians. Why is this? Because one’s parents are 
                  one’s life-givers and benefactors. So too are cows and 
                  buffalos. The flesh of one’s benefactors must not be eaten. 
                  People would rightly blame those who ate their parents, 
                  brothers, or sisters as barbaric cannibals. The same criticism 
                  should be levelled at meat-eaters because cows give us life. 
                  We owe them a great debt of gratitude, similar to that due to 
                  our parents. We should love these animals, considering their 
                  services to mankind. They are worthy of our noble love and 
                  pity, considering their enormous service for 
                  mankind.</FONT></P></TD></TR>

                  maturing of past evil kamma. Catastrophes have arisen just 
                  like that suffered by the Buddha’s relatives who were murdered 
                  by Vitatubha in revenge. Both the guilty and innocent, old and 
                  young, suffered brutal death. The whole Sakyan nation 
                  disintegrated. The Buddha appealed three times to Prince 
                  Vitatubha to let them live in peace, but the past evil kamma 
                  of the Sakyans was too great to be offset even by the Buddha’s 
                  repeated intervention. They had done serious kamma in the 
                  past, which now had to ripen. The Dhammapada Commentary [to 
                  verse forty-seven] relates this story in detail. The moral is 
                  that not even God can forgive evil kamma. Only good kamma of 
                  the highest type purifies bad kamma.</FONT></P>

                  with famine, terrorism, wars, natural disasters, drug use, 
                  etc. Even in Buddhist countries, harsh treatment of cows, 
                  killings of cows, eating of beef, etc., can be seen. 
                  Non-Buddhist countries encourage the meat-trade, forsaking the 
                  precept of non-killing.</FONT></P>

                  arms, livestock, meat, poisons, and intoxicants. These moral 
                  principles, though well-known throughout the world, are seldom 
                  observed. People lack compassion, so they become evil. Their 
                  greed for wealth and power ever increases. So they resemble, 
                  even now, hungry ghosts (petas). Seeking only their selfish 
                  ends, they behave like animals. They are too proud. Although 
                  their livelihood depends on the services of animals, they 
                  kill, torture, and eat them. They even make sport of them. 
                  Cows are man’s best friends. Butchers and meat-traders go to 
                  hell, their ingratitude being so great.</FONT></P>

                  meat-traders if they approve of killing. If one praises the 
                  prosperity of livestock farmers and meat-traders, one’s kamma 
                  is just like a butcher’s with the attendant evil results. 
                  Sometimes approvers and supporters can incur more blame than 
                  the perpetrators. It depends on the state of mind. The serious 
                  fault here is that one destroys justice and righteousness. 
                  One’s view is also wrong, which is the greatest error in the 
                  world. These facts are explained in the Vibhanga and its 
                  commentary.</FONT></P>

                  Especially in the matter of food, sellers have to depend on 
                  buyers. Money is used for further killing. So some animal 
                  species are endangered due to increased killing.</FONT></P>

                  as he likes without regard for the Dhamma. His greed compels 
                  him even to eat cows’ flesh, blind to the serious evil of 
                  ingratitude. In earning his livelihood he overlooks 
                  wrong-doing. For his immoral livelihood he gets serious 
                  effects in the lower worlds in future for the sake of benefit 
                  in the present life.</FONT></P>

                  size=-1>Some people maintain that meat improves the human body 
                  and brain. Meat is essential for our health, they say. 
                  However, the Pali text says that health is dependent on 
                  balanced living, free from excesses. Whether meat is essential 
                  is not the point. Those who eat meat without restraint suffer 
                  from diseases. Such cases are mentioned in Sutta Pitaka, 
                  Dhammapada Commentary, Jataka Commentary, etc. So one should 
                  not make excuses, nor should one follow the way of gourmets. 
                  One’s diet should be based on vegetables, ghee, and milk, with 
                  a little flesh for protein. Health is improved by moderate 
                  eating.</FONT></P>

                  size=-1>Although one may not avoid eating meat, one should try 
                  to practise the virtues of contentment and simple living. All 
                  bodhisattas hold these virtues in highest regard since they 
                  lead to supreme enlightenment. The moral for everyone is to 
                  curb the passion for tasty food to gain concentration and 
                  wisdom. Overindulgence increases mental distraction. The 
                  bodhisatta, even when the king of crows, though by nature he 
                  had to eat other animals, tried to limit his eating habits. He 
                  expressed vows and good determination to reach a higher state 
                  of mind.</FONT></P>

                  and have to suffer in silence. Wealth is obtained through the 
                  labour of cows yet many fail to show any indebtedness. People 
                  should remember that paddy, groundnuts, sesame, vegetables, 
                  etc., are obtained by tilling the land with cows. Farmers need 
                  the cow’s help. Lacking a sense of gratitude they willingly 
                  eat the cow’s flesh. If cows could speak, this barbaric crime 
                  would be exposed.</FONT></P>

                  size=-1>Consider the various ways that cows help to serve the 
                  welfare of the country. The cruel nature of meat-eaters also 
                  shows the evil of unrighteousness. Unjust people, forsaking 
                  gratitude, feed cows with insufficient or poor food. Cows are 
                  better off to die in a den of tigers than to live with 
                  ungrateful people. The cow’s sad fate under unjust men is too 
                  painful to describe. While living, excessive labour gives them 
                  little rest. When they die, or when they are killed, they 
                  become food for mankind. Kindness should be shown to them to 
                  maintain justice. Righteousness should be observed by mankind. 
                  When evil rules the world, acts of ingratitude become 
                  manifest. Through kindness towards animals, especially man’s 
                  helpers, calamities will be avoided. Right thinking persons 
                  have a duty to love cows. We must respect justice in our 
                  choice of food. This is not a minor matter. The seriousness of 
                  injustice has been shown in the teaching of the 
                  Buddha.</FONT></P>

                  turmoil and conflict. A sense of indebtedness and gratitude 
                  towards the environment and animals must be realised by human
