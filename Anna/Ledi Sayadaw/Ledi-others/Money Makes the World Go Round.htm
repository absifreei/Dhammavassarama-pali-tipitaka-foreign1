                  size=-1>Money is the driving force that makes the world go 
                  round at an ever increasing pace. It motivates much of human 
                  activity such as geological exploration, scientific research, 
                  technological advances, and politics. Money itself, of course, 
                  is not evil, but the love of money is called the root of all 
                  evil. What this really means is that greed, or desire is the 
                  root of all evil. The Buddha also said that craving is the 
                  cause of suffering.</FONT> </P>
                  <P align=justify><FONT 
                  face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif 
                  size=-1>For lay people, money is a necessary evil. They must 
                  earn money to fulfil their needs and responsibilities. If they 
                  use money wisely, it will enable them to live a happy and 
                  blameless life, and will not do them any harm. All too often, 
                  however, money takes over people’s lives, and they become 
                  obsessed with acquiring it by any means, fair or foul. What 
                  people love about money, of course, is the power that it gives 
                  to enjoy sensual pleasures. This is why the Buddha prohibited 
                  his ordained disciples from using it. The story illustrating 
                  the laying down of the rule shows how the first monk to accept 
                  money was overwhelmed by greed. When a certain monk was 
                  invited for alms to a house, the donor was unable to buy any 
                  meat to offer to him. The monk, overwhelmed by greed for meat, 
                  said, “Never mind, give me the money, and I will find meat 
                  myself.” So the Buddha made the rule prohibiting the 
                  acceptance of money.</FONT></P>
                  <P align=justify><FONT 
                  face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif 
                  size=-1>Before the rule was made, every monk knew that money 
                  was not suitable for one gone forth. The monk in the story 
                  also knew, but he could not control his greed. The rule was 
                  made to help unmindful monks to restrain their 
                  desires.</FONT></P>
                  <P align=justify><FONT 
                  face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif 
                  size=-1>How often have you looked through a sales catalogue 
                  just for idle enjoyment? How often does greed arise? Is it 
                  really a harmless activity? Our needs can be satisfied easily, 
                  but our greed is insatiable. If we win the lottery, mayhem 
                  will break loose for sure.</FONT></P>

                  face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif 
                  size=-1>When I was last in Burma I noticed that a monk had 
                  bought some lottery tickets. I said to him, “The chances of 
                  winning the lottery are really very low. The organisers of the 
                  lottery are the only ones sure to make a profit. Giving 
                  charity is better than buying lottery tickets. That way you 
                  will definitely get a huge profit in the next life — at least 
                  one thousand times what you give.” He laughed, and admitted 
                  that I was right, but said that practising charity was 
                  difficult.</FONT></P>
                  <P align=justify><FONT 
                  face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif 
                  size=-1>A monk will not have much to give away in charity if 
                  he observes the Vinaya rules strictly. He is only permitted to 
                  store an extra robe or bowl for ten days. He can keep honey or 
                  other medicine for seven days, and food only from dawn until 
                  noon on the same day. What a monk must give to others is the 
                  gift of Dhamma. He should inspire others to practise the 
                  Dhamma by being contented and easily supportable, with few 
                  wishes, and little attachment to material things. Even if he 
                  has many things, if he has little attachment to them it is 
                  good. Though he has few things, if he has much attachment to 
                  them it is bad.</FONT></P>

                  size=-1>Once, the bodhisatta was the king of Gandhāra, but 
                  abandoned his kingdom to become a recluse. His friend, the 
                  king of Videha, inspired by his example, renounced his kingdom 
                  too, to practise the Dhamma with his friend. They survived on 
                  just wild fruits and roots, but after some time became 
                  malnourished due to lack of salt. Going to a nearby village 
                  for alms they received rice and salt. The next day they had no 
                  salt for their meal again, so the Videha monk offered some 
                  salt to the Gandhāra monk. The Gandhāra monk asked, “Where did 
                  you get this salt?” His friend replied that he had kept it 
                  from the previous day. Then the bodhisatta, admonished his 
                  friend, “You renounced an entire kingdom, but you cannot 
                  renounce this worthless salt.” The Videha monk retorted, “You 
                  renounced an entire kingdom and all your followers, but now 
                  you think that you should admonish me.” However, the Gandhāra 
                  monk was able to persuade his friend that what he said was 
                  right. They continued to practise in harmony, gaining the 
                  <I>jhānas</I> and rebirth in the Brahmā realm.</FONT></P>
                  <P align=justify><FONT 
                  face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif,sans-serif 
                  size=-1>Even when he was still unenlightened and practising a 
                  Dhamma that does not lead to the end of suffering, the 
                  bodhisatta was that scrupulous. Nowadays, many monks buy food, 
                  store it up, cook it themselves, and some even eat at the

                  use with meals, though they are permitted to keep it for 
                  medicinal use. One hundred years after the Buddha passed away, 
                  the Vajji monks began to store up salt for use with meals the 
                  next day. The virtuous and learned monks ruled that this was 
                  not allowable, as it contravenes the rule regarding storing 
                  food. The Vajji monks also accepted money by putting a bowl in 
                  the midst of the Sangha and asking lay people to donate money 
                  for the Sangha’s needs. Whether it is for his own needs or for 
                  the Sangha’s needs, a monk should not accept money. People 
                  can, however, donate money to a Trust run by lay people to 
                  support a Vihara or for other Buddhist activities such as 
                  building pagodas or publishing Dhamma books. If they want to 
                  provide requisites for a monk, lay people can give some money 
                  to a temple attendant or a lay follower. Then they can invite 
                  the monk to ask for whatever he needs. In this way a monk can 
                  consent to what is allowable, but in no way can he consent to 
                  money being deposited for his own use. </FONT></P>

                  allowable, but with careful reflection this is clearly no 
                  different to using money. Since a monk can buy whatever he 
                  wants, his greed will be unrestrained. If he has to ask a lay 
                  person to get whatever he needs, this will put some limits on 
                  greed. A lay person who helps a bhikkhu in this way is called 
                  a <I>‘kappiya’</I> — one who makes things allowable, or a 
                  <I>‘veyyāvaccakaro’</I> — one who does service for others. If 
                  a monk asks his <I>kappiya</I> for something, but the 
                  <I>kappiya</I> does not provide it, the monk has no argument 
                  with the <I>kappiya.</I> If nothing is forthcoming after 
                  making reasonable efforts, the monk should inform the donor 
                  about it. The donor can then ask the <I>kappiya</I> what he 
                  has done with the money. </FONT></P>

                  them. Though they live on the charity of others, Buddhist 
                  monks are not beggars in the usual sense. In fact, a monk is 
                  not permitted to beg from others. On his almsround he can 
                  stand and wait in the hope that someone will want to give him 
                  something. However, he must not ask directly, nor hint, nor 
                  cajole. He certainly must not intimidate others into giving. 
                  So giving alms to a monk should be done respectfully. By his 
                  noble practice of living on alms the monk confers many 
                  blessings on the donor. A donor can make much merit by 
                  revering the Buddha and the Sangha, who the monk represents, 
                  even if the monk does not practise very well.</FONT></P>

                  must be forfeited to the Sangha (at least four monks). They

                  some more of this. Do you like this? What is you favourite 
                  food?” All such talk is urging the monks to indulge in sensual 
                  pleasures. Can the donors make more merit if the monks eat 
                  more food? Will they make less merit if the monk is abstemious 
                  and eats mindfully? Will the monks be able to contemplate 
                  mindfully, “Wisely reflecting, I use this food not for 
                  pleasure, not for beautification, not for fattening, but only 
                  for the maintenance of the body, to appease hunger and support 
                  the holy life”? Therefore, when offering food to monks, lay 
                  people should think only about health and nutrition, and not 
                  about pandering to the palate. They can offer whatever kind of 
                  food they like, or they can ask a monk what kind of food is 
                  most suitable for his health. A monk should eat what is good 
                  for his health. He should not flatter the donor by praising 
                  the food, or by eating it greedily.</FONT></P>

                  the recipient is unrighteous giving <I>(adhamma dāna).</I> In 
                  giving books, films, music, or other entertainments, one 
                  should consider, “Will this lead others towards the end of 
                  suffering or not?” If it stimulates lust, attachment, anger, 
                  pride, delusion, or other mental defilements, it should not be 
                  given. A few films and books may have real benefit, helping to 
                  open people’s hearts to the truth of suffering, but novels and 
                  films that do this are rare. I cannot recall listening to any 
                  music that led to anything other than attachment, though some 
                  song lyrics might have provoked some philosophical thought. If 
                  one wants to enjoy music, it is best to know that one is 
                  simply indulging in sensual pleasures. If one disguises such 
                  enjoyment as religious devotion, how will one ever understand 
                  about attachment?</FONT> </P>

                  strive to make it pleasing to the ear, otherwise the listeners 
                  may miss the meaning and get attached to the sound. Skilful 
                  orators can manipulate the audience to believe anything. Lay 
                  people should be wary of monks who are intent on fund-raising. 
                  When preaching the Dhamma, if a monk thinks, “If I preach 
                  well, I will receive many donations,” then his teaching of 
                  Dhamma becomes corrupt. He should only think, “If I preach 
                  well, the people will practise the Dhamma properly and gain 
                  immeasurable happiness.” Then the Dhamma is well taught, and 
                  not corrupted by evil wishes.</FONT></P>

                  precepts, one will still suffer the consequences of evil 
                  deeds. So one must observe the five precepts to ensure the 
                  best results from charity.</FONT> </P>

                  during, and after giving charity, one can reflect on it as a 
                  blameless action, giving happiness to everyone both now and in 
                  the future. From non-remorse the mind becomes joyful; the 
                  joyful mind is easily concentrated; and the concentrated mind 
                  can see things as they really are, leading to insight and the 
                  eventual realisation of nibbāna.</FONT> </P>

                  size=-1>Donation is like filling a car with petrol to go on a 
                  journey. If you do not know how to drive, or which way to go; 
                  or you do know, but the engine is not working; or you decide 
                  to stay at home, then you won’t arrive anywhere, however much 
                  petrol you put into the car. The car also needs five good 
                  wheels: which means the five precepts. Most important is a 
                  good steering wheel, without which one cannot drive safely. A 
                  good steering wheel means total abstention from intoxicating 
                  drinks and drugs, which cause heedlessness. Pious Buddhists 
                  are strict teetotallers.</FONT></P>

                  size=-1>To arrive at nibbāna, we need everything: charity, 
                  morality, determination, knowledge, confidence, effort, 
                  mindfulness, concentration, wisdom, and other good qualities. 
                  We must cultivate these virtues whenever we can, and use them 
                  to gain insight knowledge leading to the path, its fruition, 
                  and 
nibbāna.</FONT></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
