<P>Buddhism views the world, with the exception of Nibbána and pannatti, to be 
impermanent, liable to suffering, and without soul-essence. So Buddhist 
philosophy, to elaborate the impermanency as applied to the Law of Perpetual 
Change, has from the outset dissolved all things, all phenomena both psychical 
and physical, into a continuous succession of happenings, of states (svabhava) 
of mind and matter, under the Fivefold Law of Cosmic Order (niyama). And the 
happenings are determined and determining, both as to their constituent states 
and as to other happenings, in a variety of ways, which Buddhist Philosophy 
expresses by the term 'paccaya' or 'relations.' One complex happening of mental 
and material states, with its three phases of time--genesis or birth, cessation 
or death and a static interval between--is followed by another happening, 
wherein there is always a causal series of relations. Nothing is casual and 
fortuitous. When one happening by its arising, persisting, cessation, priority, 
and posterity, is determined by and determining another happening by means of 
producing (janaka), supporting (upathambhaka), and maintaining (anupalana), the 
former is called the relating thing (paccaya-Dhamma), the latter the related 
thing (paccayuppanna-dhamma), and the determination or the influence or the 
specific function is called the correlativity (paccayasatti). As the various 
kinds of influence are apparently known, the relations are classified into the 
following 24 species:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Hetu</B>--condition or root</P><B>
<P>Arammana</B>--object</P><B>
<P>Adhipati</B>--dominance</P><B>
<P>Anantara</B>--contiguity</P><B>
<P>Samanantara</B>--immediate contiguity</P><B>
<P>Sahajali</B>--coexistence</P><B>
<P>Annamanna</B>--reciprocity</P><B>
<P>Nissaya</B>--dependence</P><B>
<P>Upanissaya</B>--sufficing condition</P><B>
<P>Purejata</B>--pre-existence</P><B>
<P>Pacchajata</B>--causal relation of posterity in time</P><B>
<P>Asevana</B>--habitual recurrence</P><B>
<P>Kamma</B>--kamma or action</P><B>
<P>Vipaka</B>--effect</P><B>
<P>Ahara</B>/--food</P><B>
<P>Indriya</B>--control</P><B>
<P>Jhana</B>--jhana or ecstasy</P><B>
<P>Magga</B>--path</P><B>
<P>Sampayutta</B>--association</P><B>
<P>Vippayutta</B>--dissociation</P><B>
<P>Atthi</B>--presence</P><B>
<P>Natthi</B>/--absence</P><B>
<P>Vigata</B>--abeyance</P><B>
<P>Avigata</B>--continuance</P>
<P>These 24 species of relations are extensively and fully expounded in the 
seventh and last of the analytical works in the Abhidhamma Pitaka of the 
Buddhist Canon, called the Patthana ('The Eminence'), or the Maha-Pakarana ('The 
Great Book').</P>
<P>The well-known Ledi Sayadaw Mahathera, D. Litt., Aggamahapandita, has written 
in Pali a concise exposition of these relations known as Patthanudesa-dipani, in 
order to help those who wish to study the Buddhist philosophy of relations 
expounded in that Great Book. In introducing these relations to the student of 
philosophical research before he takes the opportunity of making himself 
acquainted with the methodological elaboration of correlations in the Patthana, 
the Eminent the Eminent Great Book, the Mahathera deals with the subject under 
three heads:</P>
<P>The Paccayattha-dipana or the Analytical Exposition of Relations with their 
denotations and connotations</P>
<P>The Paccaya-sabhagasangaho or the Synthesis of Relations</P>
<P>The Paccaya-ghatana-nayo or the Synchrony of Relations.</P>
<P>The following translation has been undertaken with the hope of rendering the 
Ledi Sayadaw's work intelligible to the English student. If the present 
translation makes any contribution to the advancement of learning and knowledge 
in the matter of apprehending the general scheme of causal laws in terms of 
'relations' in the field of Buddhist philosophy, the translator will deem 
himself well rewarded for his labor. It may, however, be necessary to mention 
here that the original form, sense, and meaning of the Venerable Author are, as 
far as possible, cautiously preserved; hence the literal character of the 
translation--If it appears so--in some places. Nevertheless ' the translator 
ventures to hope that any discrepancy that may have crept in, will be 
accordingly overlooked.</P>
<P>In conclusion, it is with great pleasure that I express my indebtedness to U 
Aung Hla, M.A. (Cantab.), Barrister-at-Law who has very kindly, amidst his own 
many duties, taken the trouble of revising the manuscript, and has also helped 
me in getting it through the press and in the correction of the proofs; my 
thanks are also due to Saya U Ba, M.A., A.T.M., for his valuable assistance, and 
to the printers for their courtesy and cooperation.</P>
<P>Last, but not least, I must gratefully acknowledge the timely help from U Ba 
Than and Daw Tin Tin, of Rangoon, who have voluntarily and so generously 
undertaken to meet the cost of publication of one thousand copies of the book, 
which but for their kind suggestion, would not have materialized in this 
form.</P>

<H2 align=center>Hetu-Paccaya or The Relation by Way of Root</H2></FONT><FONT 
face="Book Antiqua">
<P>What is the Hetu-relation? Greed (lobha), hate (dosa), dullness (moha), and 
their respective opposites, viz', disinterestedness (alobha), amity (adosa), 
intelligence (amoha) are all hetu-relations.</P>
<P>What are the things that are related by these hetu-relations? Those classes 
of mind and of mental qualities that are in coexistence along with greed hate, 
dullness, disinterestedness, amity, and intelligence, as well as the groups of 
material qualities which coexist with the same, are the things that are so 
related. All these are called hetupaccayuppanna Dhamma, since they arise or come 
into existence by virtue of the hetu-relation.</P>
<P>In the above exposition, by "the groups of material qualities which coexist 
with the same" are meant the material qualities produced by kamma at the initial 
moment of the hetu-conditioned conception of a new being, as well as such 
material qualities as may be produced by the hetu-conditioned mind during the 
lifetime. Here by "the moment of conception" is meant the nascent instant of the 
rebirth-conception, and by "the lifetime" is meant the period starting from the 
static instant of the rebirth-conception right on to the moment of the 
dying-thought.</P>
<P>In what sense is hetu to be understood? And in what sense paccaya? Hetu is to 
be understood in the sense of root (mulattha); and paccaya in the sense of 
assisting in the arising, or the coming to be, of the paccayuppanna Dhamma or 
upakarattha. Of these two, mulattha is the state of being a root of the root, 
greed--and so on, as shown in Mula- yamaka. We have illustrated this mulattha in 
the Mula-yamaka-dipani by the simile of a tree. However, we shall deal with it 
here again.</P>
<P>Suppose a man is in love with a woman. Now so long as he does not dispel the 
lustful thought, all his acts, words and thoughts regarding this woman, will be 
cooperating with lust (or greed), which at the same time has also under its 
control the material qualities produced by the same thought. We see then that 
all these states of mental and material qualities have their root in lustful 
greed for that woman. Hence, by being a hetu (for it acts as a root) and by 
being a paccaya (for it assists in the arising of those states of mind and 
body), greed is hetu- paccaya. The rest may be explained and understood in the 
same manner- i.e., the arising of greed by way of desire for desirable things; 
the arising of hate by way of antipathy against hateful things; and the arising 
of dullness by way of lack of knowledge respecting dull things.</P>
<P>Take a tree as an illustration--we see that the roots of a tree, having 
firmly established themselves in the ground and drawing up sap both from soil 
and water, carry that sap right up to the crown of the tree, and so the tree 
develops and grows for a long time. In the same way, greed, having firmly 
established itself in desirable things and drawing up the essence of pleasure 
and enjoyment from them, conveys that essence to the concomitant mental 
elements, till they burst into immoral acts and words. That is to say, greed 
brings about transgression as regards moral acts and words. The same is to be 
said of hate, which by way of aversion draws up the essence of displeasure and 
discomfort, and also of dullness, which by way of lack of knowledge cherishes 
the growth of the essence of vain thought on many an object.</P>
<P>Transporting the essence thus, the three elements, lobha, dosa, and moha, 
operate upon the component parts, so that they become happy (so to speak) and 
joyful at the desirable objects, etc. The component parts also become as they 
are operated upon, while the coexistent material qualities share the same 
effect. Here, from the words Sampayutta-dhamme abhiharati, it is to be 
understood that lobha transports the essence of pleasure and enjoyment to the 
concomitant elements.</P>
<P>Coming now to the bright side--suppose the man sees danger in sensual 
pleasure, and gives up that lustful thought for the woman. In doing so, 
disinterestedness as regards her arises in him. Before this, there took place 
impure acts, words and thoughts having illusion as their root; but for the time 
being these are no longer present and in their stead there arise pure acts, 
words and thoughts having their root in disinterestedness. Moreover, 
renunciation, self-control, Jhana-exercise or higher ecstatic thoughts also come 
into being. Disinterestedness (alobha), therefore, is known as hetu-paccaya, it 
being a hetu because it acts as a root, while it is a paccaya because it assists 
in the arising of the concomitant. The same explanation applies to the remainder 
of disinterestedness and also to amity and intelligence, which three are the 
opposites of greed, hate and ignorance respectively.</P>
<P>Here, just as the root of the tree stimulates the whole stem and its parts, 
so it is with disinterestedness. It dispels the desire for desirable things and 
having promoted the growth of the essence of pleasure void of greed it cherishes 
the concomitant elements with that essence till they become so happy and joyful 
that they even reach the height of Jhanic-, Path-, or Fruition-pleasure. 
Similarly, amity and intelligence respectively dispel hate and ignorance with 
regard to hateful and dull things and promote the growth of the essence of 
pleasure void of hate and dullness. Thus the operation of the three elements 
(alobha, adosa, and amoha) lasts for a long time, making their mental 
concomitants happy and joyful. The concomitant elements also become as they are 
operated upon, while the coexistent groups of material qualities are affected in 
the same way.</P>
<P>Here the word lobhavivekasukharasam is a compound of the words lobha, viveka, 
sukha and rasa. Viveka is the state of being absent. Lobhaviveka is that which 
is absent from greed, or, is the absence of greed. Lobhaviveka-sukha is the 
pleasure, which arises from the absence of greed. Hence the whole compound is 
defined thus: Lobhavivekasukharasa is the essence of pleasure, which is derived 
from the absence of greed.</P>
<P>What has just been expounded is the Law of Patthana in the Abhidhamma. 
Turning to the Law of Suttanta, the two elements of dullness and greed, which 
are respectively, termed nescience and craving, are the entire roots of all the 
three rounds of misery [1]. As to hate, it, being the incidental consequence of 
greed, is only a root of evil. The two elements of intelligence and 
disinterestedness, which are respectively termed wisdom and the element of 
renunciation, are the entire roots for the dissolution of the rounds of misery. 
As to amity, it, being the incidental consequence of disinterestedness, is only 
a root of good. Thus the six roots become the causes of all the states of mind 
and body, which are either coexistent or non-coexistent. Now what has been said 
is the Law of Suttanta.</P></FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua" size=4>

<H2 align=center>Arammana-Paccaya or the Relation of Object</H2></FONT><FONT 
face="Book Antiqua">
<P>What is the Arammana-relation? All classes of consciousness, all states of 
mental concomitants, all kinds of material qualities, all phases of nibbána, all 
terms expressive of concepts, are arammana- relations. There is, in fact, not a 
single thing (Dhamma), which does not become an object of mind and of the mental 
elements. Stated concisely, object is of six different kinds: visible object, 
audible object, odorous object, sapid object, tangible object, and cognizable 
object.</P>
<P>Which are those things that are related by the arammana-relations? All 
classes of mind and their concomitants are the things that are related by the 
arammana-relations. There is indeed not a single class of consciousness that can 
exist without its having an existing (bhutena) or non-existing (abhutena) 
object. (Bhutena and abhutena may also be rendered here as 'real' and 'unreal', 
or, as 'present' and 'non- present', respectively).</P>
<P>Here the present visible object is the arammana-paccaya, and is causally 
related to the two classes, good and bad, of consciousness of sight. Similarly, 
the present audible object is causally related to the two classes of 
consciousness of sound; the present odorous object, to the two classes of 
consciousness of smell; the present sapid object, to the two classes of 
consciousness of taste; the present three classes of tangible object, to the two 
classes of consciousness of touch; and the present five objects of sense, to the 
three classes of consciousness known as the triple element of apprehension [2]. 
All these five objects of sense, present, past or future, and all objects of 
thought, present, past, future or outside time, are arammana-paccaya and are 
causally related, severally, to the seventy-six classes of consciousness known 
as mind-cognitions (or elements of comprehension).</P>
<P>In what sense is 'arammana' to be understood, and in what sense 'paccaya'? 
Arammana is to be understood in the sense of 'alambitabba', which means that 
which is held or hung upon, so to speak, by mind and mental elements. Paccaya is 
to be understood in the sense of 'upakaraka,' which means that which assists or 
renders help (in the arising of paccayuppannadhamma.)[3]</P>
<P>Concerning the word 'alambitabba', the function of the 'alambana' of minds 
and their mental factors is to take hold of or to attach to the object. For 
instance, there is in this physical world a kind of metal, which receives its 
name of 'ayokantaka' (literally, iron-desire), lodestone, on account of its 
apparent desire for iron. When it gets near a lump of iron, it shakes itself as 
though desiring it. Moreover, it moves itself forward and attaches itself firmly 
to the iron. In other cases, it attracts the iron, and so the iron shakes 
itself, approaches the lodestone, and attaches itself firmly to it. Here we see 
the power of the lodestone, which may be taken as a striking representation of 
the 'alambana' of mind and the mental factors.</P>
<P>They (mind and its concomitants) not only attach themselves to objects, but, 
at the stage of their coming into existence within a personal entity, rise and 
cease every moment, while the objects remain present at the avenues of the six 
doors [4]. Thus the rising and ceasing is just like that of the sound of a gong, 
which is produced only at each moment we strike its surface, followed by 
immediate silence. It is also like that of the sound of a violin, which is 
produced only while we strike its strings with the bow over its strings and then 
immediately ceases.</P>
<P>To a sleeping man--while the life-continua are flowing (in the stream of 
thought)--kamma, the sign of kamma and the sign of the destiny awaiting him in 
the succeeding life--which had distinctly entered the avenues of the six doors 
at the time of approaching death in the preceding existence--are 
arammana-relations, and are causally related to (the nineteen classes of) 
consciousness known as the life- continuum.</P></FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua"

<H2 align=center>Adhipati-Paccaya or the Relation of Dominance</H2></FONT><FONT 
face="Book Antiqua">
<P>The relation of dominance is of two kinds: the objective dominance and the 
coexistent dominance. Of these two, what is the relation of objective dominance? 
Among the objects dealt with in the section on the Arammana-relation there are 
some objects, which are most agreeable, most lovable, most pleasing and most 
regard able. Such objects exhibit the relation of objective dominance. Here the 
objects may, naturally, be either agreeable or disagreeable; but by the word 
'the most agreeable objects' only those objects that are most highly esteemed by 
this or that person are meant as exhibiting this relation. Excepting the two 
classes of consciousness rooted in aversion [5] the two classes of consciousness 
rooted in ignorance and the tactual consciousness accompanied by pain, together 
with the concomitants of all these, it may be shown, analytically [6], that all 
the remaining classes of Kama- consciousness, Rupa-consciousness, 
Arupa-consciousness and Transcendental consciousness, together with all their 
respective concomitants and all the most agreeable material qualities, are 
paccaya-Dhamma.</P>
<P>Of these, Kama-objects are said to exhibit the causal relation of objective 
dominance only when they are highly regarded otherwise they do not. But those 
who reach the Jhana stages are never lacking in high esteem for the sublime 
Jhanas they have obtained. Aryan disciples also never fail in their great regard 
for the Transcendental Dhammas [7] they have obtained and enjoyed.</P>
<P>What are the things that are related by this relation? The eight classes of 
consciousness rooted in appetite (lobha), the eight classes of Kamaloka moral 
consciousness, the four classes of in-operative Kamaloka consciousness connected 
with knowledge, and the eight classes of Transcendental Consciousness--these are 
the things related by this relation. Here the six-fold mundane objects [8] are 
causally related to the eight classes of consciousness rooted in appetite. The 
seventeen classes of mundane moral consciousness are related to the four classes 
of moral Kama-consciousness disconnected from knowledge. The first three pairs 
of the Path and Fruit, and Nibbána, together with all those classes of mundane 
moral consciousness, are related to the four classes of moral Kama-consciousness 
connected with knowledge. The highest--the fourth stage of the Path and Fruit of 
Arahantship--together with Nibbána are related to the four classes of 
inoperative Kama-consciousness connected with knowledge. And Nibbána is related 
to the eight classes of Transcendental Consciousness.</P>
<P>In what sense is arammana to be understood, and in what sense Adhipati? 
Arammana is to be understood in the sense of alambitabba (cf. arammana-paccaya) 
and adhipati in the sense of adhipaccattha. Then what is adhipaccattha? 
Adhipaccattha is the potency of objects to control those states of mind and 
mental qualities by which the objects are highly regarded. It is to be 
understood that the relating things (paccaya-Dhamma) of arammanadhipati resemble 
the overlords, while the related things (paccayuppanna-dhamma) resemble the 
thralls in human society.</P>
<P>In the Sutasoma Jataka, Porisada, the king, owing to his extreme delight in 
human flesh, abandoned his kingdom solely for the sake of the taste of human 
flesh and lived a wanderer's life in the forest. Here the savor of human flesh 
is the paccayadhamma of arammanadhipati; and King Porisada's consciousness 
rooted in appetite is the paccayuppana- Dhamma. And again, King Sutasoma, having 
a very high regard for Truth [9], forsook his sovereignty, all his royal family 
and even his life for the sake of Truth, and went to throw himself into the 
hands of Porisada. In this case, Truth is the paccayadhamma and King Sutasoma's 
moral consciousness is the paccayuppannadhamma. Thus must we understand all 
objects of sense to which great regard is attached.</P>
<P>What is the relation of coexistent dominance? Intention or desire- to-do, 
mind [10] or will, energy or effort, and reason or investigation, which have 
arrived at the dominant state, belong to this relation.</P>
<P>What are the things related by this relation? Classes of mind and of mental 
qualities, which are adjuncts of the dominants, and material qualities produced 
by dominant thoughts are the things that are related by this relation.</P>
<P>In what sense is sahajata to be understood, and in what sense adhipati? 
Sahajata is to be understood in the sense of sahuppadanattha, and adhipati in 
the sense of abhibhavanattha. Here, a phenomenon, when it appears not only 
appears alone, but simultaneously causes its adjuncts to appear. Such a causal 
activity of the phenomenon is termed the sahuppadanattha. And the term 
abhibhavanattha means overcoming. For instance, King Cakkavatti, by his own 
power or merit, overcomes and becomes lord of the inhabitants of the whole 
continent whom he can lead according to his own will. They also become according 
as they are led. In like manner, those four influences, which have arrived at 
the dominant stage become lord of, and lead, so to speak, their adjuncts to be 
at their will in each of their respective functions. The adjuncts also become 
according as they are led. To take another example, in each of these masses, 
earth, water, fire, and air, we see that the four elements--extension, cohesion, 
heat, and motion--are respectively predominant, and each has supremacy over the 
other three components and makes them conform to its own intrinsic nature [11]. 
The other three members of the group of four 'elements' also have to follow 
after the nature of the predominant element. In the same way, these four 
dominants, which have arrived at the dominant stage through their power, make 
the adjuncts conform to their own intrinsic nature. And their adjuncts also have 
to follow after the nature of the dominants. Such is the meaning of abhibhavana. 
Here some might say: "If these things, leaving out intention, are to be called 
dominants on account of their overcoming the adjuncts, greed also ought to be 
called a dominant, for obviously it possesses a more overwhelming power over the 
adjuncts than intention." But to this we may reply: Greed is, indeed, more 
powerful than intention, but only with ordinary unintelligent men. With the 
wise, intention is more powerful than greed in overwhelming the adjuncts. If it 
is assumed that greed is more powerful, then how should people, who are in the 
hands of greed, give up the repletion of their happy existence and wealth, carry 
out the methods of renunciation, and escape from the circle of misery? But, 
because intention is more powerful than greed, therefore those people who are in 
the hands of greed are able to give up the repletion of happy existence and 
wealth, fulfill the means of renunciation, and escape from the circle of misery. 
Hence, intention is a true dominant,--and not greed. The like should be borne in 
mind--in the same fashion--when intention is contrasted with hate, and so 
forth.</P>
<P>Let us explain this more clearly. When there arise great and difficult manly 
enterprises, the accomplishment of such enterprises necessitates the arising of 
these four dominants. How? When ill-intentioned people encounter any such 
enterprise, their intention recedes. They are not willing to undertake it. They 
leave it, having no inclination for it, and even say: "The task is not within 
the range of our ability." As to well-intentioned people, their intention 
becomes full of spirit at the sight of such a great enterprise. They are very 
willing to undertake it. They make up their mind to accomplish the task, saying: 
"This has been set within the orbit of our ability." A person of this type is so 
persuaded by his intention that he is unable to give up the enterprise during 
the course of his undertaking, so long as it is not yet accomplished. And since 
this is the case the task will some day arrive at its full accomplishment even 
though it may be a very great one.</P>
<P>Now, let us turn to the case of men of the indolent class. When they come 
face to face with such a great task they at once shrink from it. They shrink 
from it because they foresee that they will have to go through great hardships 
and also undergo bodily and mental pain if they wish to accomplish it. As to the 
industrious man, he becomes filled with energy at the sight of it and wishes to 
set himself to it. He goes on through thick and thin with the performance of the 
task for any length of time. He never turns back from his exertions, nor does he 
become disappointed. What he only thinks about is that such a great task cannot 
be accomplished without unswerving efforts every day and every night. And this 
being the case, the great task will certainly reach its end one day.</P>
<P>Let us take the case of the feeble-minded. They also turn away when they see 
such a great task. They will certainly never think of it again. But it is quite 
different with the strong-minded person. When he sees such a task he becomes 
highly interested in it. He is quite unable to dispel the thought of it. He is 
all the time wrapped up in thoughts about the task, and at its bidding sets 
himself to it for a long time, enduring all kinds of bodily and mental pain. The 
remainder should hereafter be explained in the same manner as the dominant 
intention above.</P>
<P>Again a few words about unintelligent men. When they are confronted with such 
a task they become blinded. They know not how to begin, nor how to go on with 
the work, nor how to bring it to its end. They feel as if they had entered the 
dark where not a single light of inclination towards its performance has been 
set up to guide them. On the other hand--to take the more intelligent case--when 
a person of this type has to tackle such a great task he feels as if he were 
lifted up to the summit of his intellect, whereupon he discerns whence to start 
and whither to end. He also knows what advantage and blessing will accrue to him 
from its performance. He invents many devices for its easy accomplishment. He 
continues on with the work for a long time, and so on and so forth. The rest 
should be explained in the same manner as the dominant effort--only inserting 
the words 'with an enormous amount of investigation' in place of 'unswerving 
efforts'.</P>
<P>Thus, when there arise great and difficult manly enterprises, these four 
dominants become predominant among the means of their accomplishment. Owing to 
the existence of these four dominants there exist distinguished or dignified 
persons (personages) such as the Omniscient Buddhas, the Pacceka Buddhas, [12] 
the most eminent disciples, the great disciples and the ordinary disciples. 
Owing to the appearance of such personages, there also appear, for the general 
prosperity and welfare of mankind numerous [13] arts and sciences, as well as 
general articles of furniture to suit and serve human needs and wants under the 
canopy of civilization.</P></FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua" size=4>

<H2 align=center>Anantara-Paccaya or the Relation of Contiguity</H2></FONT><FONT 
face="Book Antiqua">
<P>What is the Anantara-paccaya? All classes of consciousness and their mental 
concomitants, which have just ceased (in the immediately preceding instant), are 
anantara-paccayas. Which are those that are related by this paccaya? All classes 
of consciousness and their mental concomitants, which have just arisen (in the 
immediately succeeding instant), are related by this paccaya.</P>
<P>In one existence of a being, the rebirth-consciousness is related to the 
first life-continuum by way of contiguity, and the first life-continuum is again 
related to the second life-continuum; and so on with the rest.</P>
<P>Now with reference to the Text, "When the second unmoral consciousness arises 
to the Pure (those of Pure abode, i.e. Suddhavasa), etc.," which is expounded in 
the Dhamma-Yamaka, the ninth chapter of the Sixth Book of Abhidhamma, we 
understand that, as he becomes aware of his new body, the first process of 
thought which occurs to a being in his new life is the process of unmoral 
thought accompanied by a strong desire to live the new life, with the idea: 
'This is mine; this am I; this is Myself." When this process is about to occur, 
the life-continuum vibrates first for two moments. Next comes the mind-door 
apprehension, and then follows a series of seven apperceptives, accompanied by a 
strong desire to live the new life. Thereafter, life-continua begin to flow 
again.</P>
<P>In fact, this being [14] does not know anything of his present new life. He 
lives, reflecting on what he had experienced in the previous existence. The 
basis of mind, however, is too weak, so that the object also cannot be clearly 
reflected. The object being thus indistinct, there generally arise only such 
classes of consciousness as are conjoined with perplexity.</P>
<P>After two months or so from the time of impregnation, during which period the 
individual is gradually developing, the controlling powers of the eyes, ears, 
etc., complete their full development. But there being no light, and so on, in 
the womb of the mother, the four classes of cognition--visual, auditory, and so 
on--do not arise. Only the tactile cognition and the mind-cognition arise. The 
child suffers much pain and distress at every change of the mother's bodily 
posture, and much more so while he is being born. Even after he has come into 
the outer world, he has to lie very feebly on his back till the delicate body 
becomes strong enough (lit., reaches the state of maturity) to bear itself. 
During this period, he cannot cognize present objects, but his mind generally 
turns towards the objects of his previous existence. If he comes from the 
hell-world, he generally presents an unpleasant face, for he still feels what he 
had experienced in the hell-world. If he comes from the abode of devas, his 
pleasant face not only shines with smiles, but in its joyous expression of 
laugh, as it were, he shows his happiness at some thought of the objects of the 
Deva-world.</P>
<P>Furthermore, the members of his body steadily become stronger, and his 
sense-impressions clearer. So he is soon able to play joyfully in his own dear 
little ways. A happy life is thus begun for him; and he begins to take an 
interest in his new life. He takes to and imitates his mother's speech. He 
prattles with her. Thus his senses almost entirely turn to the present world, 
and all his reflections of the previous life fade away. That is to say, he 
forgets his previous existence.</P>
<P>Do all beings forget their previous existences only at this period of life? 
No, not all beings. Some who are very much oppressed with the pain of 
conception, forget their previous existences during the period of pregnancy, 
some at the time of birth, some at the aforesaid period; some during the period 
of youth, and some in old age. Some extraordinary men do not forget for the 
whole of their lifetime, and there are even some who are able to reflect two or 
three previous existences. They are called Jatissarasatta, those gifted with the 
memory of their previous existences.</P>
<P>Now, to return to our subject. Though the six-door processes of thought begin 
to work after the child has been born, yet the six-door processes work 
themselves out in full action only when the child is able to take up present 
objects. Thus, in every process of thought, every preceding consciousness that 
has just ceased is related to every succeeding consciousness that has 
immediately arisen, by way of contiguity. And this relation of contiguity 
prevails throughout the whole span of the recurring existences of an individual, 
right from the untraceable beginning, with unbroken continuity. But only after 
he has attained the Path of Arahantship and has entered the Khandha-Parinibbána 
(i.e. the final extinction of the Five Aggregates), does this continuum break, 
or, more strictly speaking, cease forever.</P>
<P>Why is anantara so called, and why paccaya? Anantara is so called because it 
causes such states of phenomena as are similar to its own to succeed in the 
immediately following instant. Paccaya is so called because it renders help. In 
the phrase 'similar to its own', the word 'similar' is meant to express 
similarity in respect of having the faculty of being conscious of an object. And 
Sarammanta means a phenomenon, which does not occur without the presence of an 
object. So it has been rendered as 'similar in respect of having the faculty', 
and so forth.</P>
<P>Also the phrase "Dhammantarassa-uppadanatthena" expresses the following 
meaning:-"Though the preceding thought ceases, the conscious faculty of it does 
not become extinct until it has caused the succeeding thought to arise."</P>
<P>Here it should be borne in mind that the series of paccaya-Dhammas of this 
relation resembles a series of preceding mothers, and the series of 
paccayuppanna-dhamma resembles a series of succeeding daughters. This being so, 
the last dying-thought of an Arahant should also cause the arising of a 
rebirth-consciousness. But it does not do so, for, at the close of the evolution 
of existence, all activities of volitions and defilements (Kamma-kilesa) have 
entirely ceased, and the last dying-thought has reached the final, ultimate 
quiescence.</P>

<H2 align=center>Samanantara-Paccaya or the Relation of Immediate 
Contiguity</H2></FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua">
<P>The classifications of the paccaya-Dhammas and paccayuppanna-dhamma of this 
relation, are, all of them, the same as those of the anantarapaccaya.</P>
<P>In what sense is samanantara to be understood? Samanantara is to be 
understood in the sense of 'thorough immediateness'. How? In a stone pillar, 
though the groups of matter therein seem to unite into one mass, they are not 
without the material quality of limitation or space, which intervenes between 
them, for matter, is substantial and formative. That is to say, there exists an 
element of space, called mediary or cavity, between any two units of matter. But 
it is not so with immaterial qualities. There does not exist any space, mediary 
or cavity, between the two consecutive groups of mind and mental concomitants. 
That is to say, they (groups of mind and mental concomitants) are entirely 
without any mediacy, because the mental state is not substantial and formative. 
The mediacy between two consecutive groups of mind and mental concomitants is 
also not known to the world. So it is thought that mind is permanent, stable, 
stationary, and immutable. Hence, samanantara' is to be understood in the sense 
of 'thorough immediateness'.</P>
<P>Anantarattha has also been explained in the foregoing relation as Attano 
anantare attasadisassa dhammantarassa uppadanatthena; that is because it causes 
such states of phenomena as are similar to its own to succeed in the immediately 
following instant. This being so, some such suggestion as follows might be put 
forward: at the time of 'sustained cessation' [15] (nirodhasamapatti), the 
preceding consciousness is that of neither-consciousness-nor-unconsciousness, 
and the succeeding consciousness is that of the Aryan Fruit. Between these two 
classes of consciousness, the total suspension of thought occurs either for one 
day, or for two, or three... or even for seven days. Also in the abode of 
unconscious beings, the preceding consciousness is that of decease (cuticitta, 
the dying-thought) from the previous Kamaloka; and the succeeding one is that of 
rebirth (patisandhicitta) in the following Kamaloka. Between these two classes 
of consciousness, the total suspension of thought of the unconscious being 
occurs for the whole term of life amounting to five hundred kappas or great 
aeons.</P>
<P>Hence, is it not correct to say that the two classes of preceding 
consciousness are without the faculty of causing to arise something similar to 
themselves in an immediately following instant? The reply to this is: No, they 
are not without this faculty. The faculty has only been retarded in its 
operation for a certain extended period, through certain highly cultivated 
contemplations and resolutions made. When the preceding thoughts cease, they 
cease together with the power, which they possess, of causing something to arise 
similar to themselves. And the succeeding thoughts, being unable to arise in 
continuity at that immediate instant, arise only after the lapse of the 
aforesaid extent of time. It cannot be rightly said that they (the preceding 
thoughts) do not possess the faculty of causing to arise something similar to 
themselves, or that they are not anantara-relations only because of a suspension 
of operation of the faculty. For, we do not speak of a king's armies when they 
are not actually in a battle or in the very act of fighting, or while they are 
roaming about, not being required to fight by the king, who at such times may 
say, "My men, it is not the proper time for you yet to fight. But you shall 
fight at such and such a time." We do not then say that they are not armies or 
that they have no fighting qualities. In precisely the same way, the relation 
between the two aforesaid preceding thoughts is to be understood.</P>
<P>Here some might say: 'It has just been said in this relation that both the 
relating and the related things, being incorporeal qualities having no form 
whatever and having nothing to do with any material quality of limitation 
(space) intervening between, are entirely without mediacy or cavity. If this be 
so, how shall we believe the occurrence at every moment, of the arising and 
ceasing of consciousness, which has been explained in the arammana-paccaya by 
the illustration of the sound of a gong and of a violin? We may answer this 
question by asserting the fact, which is quite obvious in the psychical world 
that the various classes of consciousness are in a state of continual flux, 
i.e., in a continuous succession of change. It has also been explained, in 
detail, in the essays on Citta Yamaka.</P></FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua"

<H2 align=center>Sahajata-Paccaya or the Relation of 
coexistence</H2></FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua">
<P>The classifications of the paccaya and paccayuppanna-Dhammas of this relation 
will now be dealt with. All coexistent classes of consciousness and their mental 
concomitants are each mutually termed paccaya and paccayuppanna-Dhammas. So also 
are the mental aggregates of rebirth and the basis of mind, which coexist with 
rebirth; and so also are the Great Essentials, mutually among themselves. All 
the material qualities born of Kamma at the moment of rebirth and all the 
material qualities which are born of mind, during life, at the nascent instant 
of each momentary state of consciousness (which is capable of producing material 
quality), are merely termed the paccayuppanna-Dhammas, of that coexistent 
consciousness. All the material qualities derived from the Great Essentials are, 
however, termed the paccayuppanna-Dhammas of the Great Essentials.</P>
<P>In what sense is sahajata to be understood, and in what sense paccaya? 
Sahajata is to be understood in the sense of coexistence, and paccaya in the 
sense of rendering help. Here, coexistence means that when a phenomenon arises, 
it arises together with its effect; or, in other words, also causes its effect 
to arise simultaneously. Such is the meaning of coexistence implied here. For 
example, when the sun rises, it rises together with its heat and light. And when 
a candle is burning, it burns together with its heat and light. So also, this 
relating thing, in arising, arises together with related things.</P>
<P>In this example, the sun is like each of the mental states; the sun's heat 
like the coexisting mental states; and the sun's light is like the coexisting 
material qualities. Similarly, the sun is like each of the Great Essentials; its 
heat, the coexisting Great Essentials; and its light, the coexisting material 
qualities derived from them. In the example of the candle, it should be 
understood in a similar way.</P></FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua" size=4>

<H2 align=center>Annamanna-Paccaya or the Relation of 
Reciprocity</H2></FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua">
<P>What has been spoken of the paccaya-Dhammas in the classifications of the 
relation of coexistence is here (in this relation) the paccaya as well as the 
paccayuppanna-Dhammas. All states of consciousness and their mental concomitants 
are, reciprocally, the paccaya and the paccayuppanna- Dhammas; so are the 
coexisting Great Essentials; so are the mental aggregates of rebirth; and so is 
the basis of mind or heart-base which coexists with the mental aggregates of 
rebirth.</P>
<P>As to the sense implied here, it is easy to understand. However, an 
illustration will not be uninteresting. When three sticks are set upright 
leaning against one another at their upper ends, each of them depends on, and is 
depended on by, the other two. As long as one of them remains in such an upright 
position, so long will all remain in the same position. And, if one of them 
falls, all will fall at the same time. Exactly so should this relation of 
reciprocity be understood.</P>
<P>Here, if any one should assert that the mental properties are not able to 
arise without consciousness rendering them service as their base, we would 
acknowledge that this is so. Why? Because the function of knowing is predominant 
among the functions of contact, and so forth, of the mental properties, and, in 
the Dhammapada, as expounded by the Omniscient Buddha, 'mind is predominant' 
(Manopubbangama Dhamma, etc.) And again if anyone holds that consciousness also 
is not able to arise without the mental properties as a correlative, we will 
support this view. They (mental properties) are concomitant factors of 
consciousness; therefore, consciousness also is not able to arise without its 
accompanying mental properties. In a similar way are the four Great Essentials 
to be understood. But the mental qualities derived from them should not be 
counted as concomitant factors, for they are only derivatives. Then are the 
material qualities of life and those born of food not concomitant factors, 
seeing that they can exercise, individually, the causal relation of control and 
that of food? No, they are not. They may be taken as concomitant factors only 
when the development is in full swing, but not when things are only at the state 
of genesis. In this relation of reciprocity, the arising of concomitants at the 
stage of genesis is a necessary factor.</P>

<H2 align=center>Nissaya Paccaya or the Relation of Dependence</H2></FONT><FONT 
face="Book Antiqua">
<P>The relation of dependence is of three kinds: coexistent dependence, basic 
pre-existent dependence, and basic objective pre-existent dependence.</P>
<P>Of these, what is the relation of coexistent dependence? The relation of 
coexistent dependence embraces all those that are already comprised in the 
relation of coexistence. Hence the classifications of relation and related 
things ought here to be understood in the same way as those that have already 
been set out in the section on the relation of coexistence.</P>
<P>And what is the relation of basic pre-existent dependence? There are six 
bases--eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and heart. These six bases, during life, are 
causally related, by way of basic pre-existent dependence, to the seven elements 
of cognition. The material base itself pre-exists and serves as a standing 
ground or substratum, and it is therefore called 'basic pre-existent 
dependence'. Here 'basic' is so called because of its being a standing ground or 
substratum for mind and mental properties. 'To pre-exist' means to exist 
beforehand--one thought-moment earlier than its related thing.</P>
<P>Here the rebirth consciousness arises in dependence upon the heart basis [16] 
that coexists with it, for there is no pre-existent physical base at that 
moment. And the first life-continuum arises in dependence upon the same 
heart-basis, which coexists with the rebirth- consciousness. The second 
life-continuum arises also in dependence upon the heart-basis which coexists 
with the first life-continuum, and so on with the rest, that is, the third 
life-continuum arises in dependence upon the heart-basis that coexists with the 
second life-continuum, and so on and on, until comes the moment of death. Thus 
should be understood the 'basic pre-existent dependence, which relates to the 
two elements of cognition, the element of apprehension and the element of 
comprehension.</P>
<P>Just as a violin sounds only when the violin-bow moves across its strings, 
and not otherwise, so also the five senses awake only when the five kinds of 
sense-objects enter the five avenues known as 'five bases', and not 
otherwise.</P>
<P>The impression is possible only at the static period of the object and of the 
basis. On account of the impression, the life-continuum vibrates for two 
moments. And, on account of the vibration of the life- continuum, apprehension 
occurs. On account of apprehension, the five sense-cognitions are able to arise. 
Therefore, the five sense-bases (eye, ear, etc.), which have arisen at the 
nascent instant of the past sub-consciousness, are the 'basic pre-existent 
dependences' of the five elements of sense-cognition.</P>
<P>Now, at the time of death all the six bases come into being only at the 
nascent instant of the seventeenth sub-consciousness, reckoned backward from the 
dying-consciousness. No new bases occur after that seventeenth 
sub-consciousness. So, at the time of death, all sub- consciousness, all 
six-door-process-cognitions and consciousness of decease arise in dependence 
upon these, their respective bases that came into being together with the 
seventeenth sub-consciousness which has arisen previously to them. This is the 
causal relation of 'basic pre- existent dependence'.</P>
<P>What is the causal relation of 'basic objective pre-existent dependence'? 
When one is reflecting and holding the view: 'my mind locates itself in 
dependence upon the matter which is mine, or myself, or my attá', through 
craving, conceit, and error; or when one is reasoning or speculating thus: 'my 
mind locates itself in dependence upon matter which is Impermanence, Ill, and 
No-soul', there arise mind- door cognitions, such as determining, and so forth. 
During that time,</FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua" size=4> </FONT><FONT 
face="Book Antiqua">each of the material bases becomes the standing ground for, 
and also the object of, each of the mind-door cognitions. Therefore, such and 
such a heart-basis is causally related to such and such a consciousness and its 
concomitants, by way of basic objective pre-existent dependence. This is the 
causal relation of 'basic objective pre-existent dependence'. Hence the relation 
of dependence is of three different kinds.</P>
<P>Here, the dependence by way of Suttanta should also be mentioned. We know 
that men, animals, trees, and so forth, stand or rest on the earth; the earth in 
turn, on the great mass of air; and the air, on the limitless empty space 
underneath. We also know that men establish themselves in houses; Bhikkhus, in 
viharas or monasteries; devas in celestial mansions; and so on with the whole 
universe. Thus should we understand that everything is causally related to 
something else by way of dependence!</P></FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua" size=4>

the Relation of Sufficing Condition</H2></FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua">
<P>The relation of sufficing condition is of three kinds: objective sufficing 
condition, contiguous sufficing condition and natural sufficing condition. Of 
these three, the first is the same as objective dominance, and the second as 
contiguity.</P>
<P>What is 'natural sufficing condition'? All past, present and future, internal 
and external, classes of consciousness together with their concomitants, all 
material qualities, Nibbána and concepts (pannatti), are natural sufficing 
conditions, severally</FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua" size=4> </FONT><FONT 
face="Book Antiqua">related, as the case may be, to all the present classes of 
consciousness and their concomitants.</P>
<P>Here, the Buddha who passed away and has entered Nibbána, His Dhamma, the 
Fraternity of His sanctified disciples, and the successions of the recognized 
Fraternity, are causally related to us, of later generations, by way of natural 
sufficing condition, for the cultivation of good. In the same way, our 
forefathers, in their respective capacities as parents, teachers, wise monks and 
Brahmins, eminent philosophers, and powerful and august kings, are also causally 
related to the succeeding generations by way of natural sufficing condition, 
either for the cultivation of good or of evil, or for the experience of pleasure 
or of pain. For which reason,, they established or propounded various laws and 
sayings, moral and immoral, and also worldly institutions--both for the welfare 
and otherwise of the succeeding generations. The future generations also follow 
their paths and adopt their customs by doing acts of charity, by observing the 
precepts, and so forth, by practicing the moral and social laws of the world, by 
adhering to various religious beliefs, by taking up various kinds of 
occupations, by studying various branches of arts and science, by governing 
hamlets, villages and towns, by being agriculturists in the field and on the 
farm, by digging lakes, ponds and wells, by building houses, by making carriages 
and carts, by building boats, steamers and ships, and by seeking for and 
accumulating wealth, such as silver, gold, precious stones, pearls and so forth 
and so on. Thus the world has developed unceasingly.</P>
<P>The future Buddha (Metteyya), His Dhamma and His Fraternity are natural 
sufficing conditions, being causally related to the present generation, for the 
acquirement of virtues, and the gaining of merit. Supremacy, wealth, power, 
prosperity--which are to be gained in the future--are also natural sufficing 
conditions, related to the present generation for the putting forth of efforts 
of all sorts. The acquirement of happy existence and wealth and the attainment 
of Path, Fruition and Nibbána, which are to be enjoyed in the future, are also 
natural sufficing conditions, related to the present generation of men for the 
development of such forms of merit as charity, virtue and so on.</P>
<P>With the hope of reaping crops in winter, men till the soil and sow seeds in 
the rainy season, or they do various kinds of work, which incur labor and 
intellect, with the hope of getting money upon their completion of the work. 
Now, the crops to be reaped and the money to be got are future natural sufficing 
conditions, related to the acquisition of crops and money. In the same manner, 
most people in the present life do many good deeds, realizing that they will 
reap the fruits of their deeds in some life hereafter. In this case, the fruits, 
which will be reaped in future, are future natural sufficing conditions, related 
to the deeds done in the present life. Deeds done before are also past natural 
sufficing conditions, related to the fruits, which are to be reaped in the 
future. Thus we see that the future natural sufficing condition is as large and 
wide as the past.</P>
<P>The living Buddha, His Dhamma, and so on, are present natural sufficing 
conditions, being related to the present living men, Devas and Brahmas, and so 
are living parents to living sons and daughters, and so on. The present natural 
sufficing condition is thus obvious and easy to understand.</P>
<P>Internal natural sufficing conditions are those that exist in an animate 
person, such as the Buddha, and so forth. External natural sufficing conditions 
are conditions, such as lands, mountains, rivers, oceans and so on, which serve 
as resting places for the existence of life (sentient beings); or such as 
forests, woods, trees, grasses, grains, beans and so forth; or such as the moon, 
the sun, the planets, the stars and so on; or such as rain, fire, wind, cold, 
heat, and so forth, which are useful and advantageous to life in one way or 
another. All these are the more powerful sufficing conditions, either for the 
accomplishment of good or for the spreading of evil; either for the enjoyment of 
pleasures or for the suffering of pains.</P>
<P>Those with an earnest desire to enter Nibbána in the present life work out 
the factors of enlightenment. Those with an ardent hope to enter Nibbána in the 
lives to come when Buddhas will appear fulfill the</FONT><FONT 
face="Book Antiqua" size=4> </FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua">perfections. Here, 
Nibbána is the more powerful sufficing condition for the cultivation of these 
tasks.</P>
<P>A large variety of concepts or names-and-notions, commonly employed, or found 
in the Tipitakas of the Buddha, are also sufficing conditions for the 
understanding of many things.</P>
<P>In fact, all conditioned things here come to be only when there are present 
causes or conditions for the same, and not otherwise. And they stand only if 
there are present causes for their standing; otherwise they do not. Therefore, 
causes or conditions are needed for their arising as well as for their 
maintenance. However, Nibbána and concepts are things, unconditioned, without 
birth and genesis, everlasting and eternal. Therefore, no causes are needed for 
their arising and maintenance. [17]</P>
<P>The Moral is causally related to that which is moral by way of sufficing 
condition. A clear exposition of this is given in the Patthana, where it is 
said: "Through faith one gives charity, observes the precepts and so on." 
Similarly, that moral is causally related to immoral--and unspecified [18] or 
unmoral to unmoral--by way of sufficing condition is made clear by these 
expositions: "Through lust one commits murder, theft and so on," and "Through 
suitable climate and food, one enjoys physical health and so forth." The Moral 
is also causally related to that which is immoral by way of more powerful 
sufficing condition. This is to be understood from the following exposition: 
"One may give charity, and thereupon exalt oneself and revile others. In the 
same manner, having observed the precepts, having attained concentration of 
mind, and having acquired learning, one may exalt oneself and belittle 
others."</P>
<P>The Moral is also causally related to that which is unmoral by way of more 
powerful sufficing condition. All good deeds done in the four planes (these four 
planes are the spheres of Kama, Rupa, Arupa and Lokuttara), and all actions 
connected with doing good, are related, by way of more powerful sufficing 
condition, to un-morals of the resultant kind, producible at a remote period. 
Those who practice for the Perfection of charity, suffer much physical and 
mental pain. Similarly, those who practice for such other Perfections (Paramita) 
as of morality, abnegation, wisdom, perseverance, patience, sincerity, 
resolution, love, and resignation, suffer the same. It is likewise with those 
who practice the course of Jhana and Magga ("supernormal thought" and the 
Path).</P>
<P>Immorals are also causally related, by way of more powerful sufficing 
condition, to morals. For instance, some on this earth, having done wrong, 
repent their deeds and better themselves to shun all such evil deeds, by 
cultivating such moral acts as giving charity, observing the precepts, 
practicing Jhanas and Maggas. Thus the evil deeds they have done are related, by 
way of stronger sufficing condition, to the moral acts they cultivate later.</P>
<P>Immorals are also causally related, by way of more powerful sufficing 
condition, to un-morals. For instance, many people in this world, having been 
guilty of evil deeds, are destined to fall into one of the four planes of 
misery, and undergo pains of suffering which prevail there. Even in the present 
life, some, through their own misdeeds or the misdeeds of others, have to bear a 
great deal of distress. Some, however, enjoy a large variety of pleasures with 
the money they earn by their misconduct. There are also many who suffer much on 
account of lust, hate, error, conceit, and so forth.</P>
<P>Un-morals are also causally related by way of more powerful sufficing 
condition to morals. Having become possessed of great wealth, one gives charity, 
practices for the perfection of good morals, fosters wisdom, and practices the 
religious exercises in a suitable place, such as a monastery, a hollow place, a 
cave, a tree, a forest, a hill, or a village, where the climate is agreeable and 
food is available.</P>
<P>Un-morals are also causally related by way of more powerful sufficing 
conditions to immorals. Being equipped with eyes, many evils are born of sight 
within oneself. A similar explanation applies to our equipment with ears, etc.; 
so also as regards hands, legs, swords, arms, etc. It is thus that sufficing 
condition is of three kinds.</P>
<P>Sufficing condition by way of Suttanta [19] may also be mentioned here. It is 
found in many such passages in the Pitakas as, "through intercourse with 
virtuous friends", "through association with sinful companions", "by living in 
the village", "by dwelling in the forest", and so forth. In short, the five 
cosmic orders (Panca-niyamadhamma) are the stronger sufficing conditions 
relating to the three worlds--the animate world, the inanimate world, and the 
world of space, to go on unceasingly through aeons of time. This also has been 
expounded at length by us in the Niyamadipani [20].</P>
<P>Why is arammanupanissaya so called? It is so called because the dominant 
object acts as a main basis for subjects (arammanika).</P>
<P>Why is anatarupanissaya so called? It is so called because the preceding 
consciousness acts as a main basis for the arising of its immediate succeeding 
consciousness. The preceding consciousness is just like the mother, and the 
succeeding one, the son. Here, just as the mother gives birth to the son who 
owes his existence to her in particular, so also the preceding consciousness 
gives birth to the succeeding one, which owes its existence particularly to its 
predecessor.</P>
<P>Why is pakatupanissaya so called? It is so called because it is naturally 
known to the wise as a distinct sufficing condition. Here, something further 
requires to be said. The influence of a sufficing condition in contiguity 
pervades only its immediate successor, but that of a natural sufficing condition 
can pervade many remote ones. Therefore, what in this present life has been 
seen, heard, smelt, tasted, touched and experienced in days, months, years, long 
gone by, takes form again at the mind-door, even after a lapse of a hundred 
years, if a sufficient cause is available. And so people remember their past, 
and can utter such expressions as "I saw it before", "I heard it before", and so 
on. These beings, whose birth is apparitional [21], also remember their former 
existences; likewise, some among men, who are gifted with the memory of their 
former existences, can do so. If one out of a hundred thousand objects 
experienced before be met with afterwards, many or, it may be, all of them 
reappear in the process of thought.</P></FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua" size=4>

<H2 align=center>Purejata-Paccaya or the Relation of 
Pre-Existence</H2></FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua">
<P>The relation of pre-existence is of three kinds: basic pre-existence, 
objective pre-existence, and basic objective pre-existence.</P>
<P>Of these, the first and the last have already been dealt with under the 
heading of Nissaya in the foregoing section on the Nissaya-relation.</P>
<P>Objective pre-existence is the name given to the present eighteen, kinds of 
material qualities of the determined class (nipphanna). Of these, the present 
five objects (visible form, sound, and so forth) are causally related, always by 
way of objective pre-existence, to those thoughts, which are capable 
of</FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua" size=4> </FONT><FONT 
face="Book Antiqua">taking part in the five-door processes. Just as the sound of 
the violin only arises when it is played with a bow, and the sounding 
necessitates the pre-existence of both the violin strings and the violin bow, so 
also those thoughts, which take part in the five-door processes, spring into 
being owing to the presentation of the five objects of sense at the five doors, 
which are no other than the five bases. The presentation is possible only when 
the door and the object are in their static stages. Those five objects not only 
present themselves at the five doors of the five senses at that static period, 
but they also present themselves at the mind-door. On this account, the 
life-continuum vibrates for two moments, and then ceases; and the cessation of 
the life-continuum gives rise to a consciousness-series. This being so, the 
consciousness-series in any process cannot arise without the pre-existence of 
the objects and of the bases. The eighteen kinds of determined material 
qualities are either past, because they have ceased, or future, because they 
have not yet arisen, or present, inasmuch as they are still existing. All of 
them, without distinction, may be objects of the mind-door cognitions. But, 
among them, only the present objects act as objective pre-existence. And if a 
thing in any distant place, or concealed from sight, itself existing, becomes an 
object of mind, it also may be called a present object.</P></FONT><FONT

the Relation of Post-Existence</H2></FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua">
<P>Every posterior consciousness that springs into being, causally relates to 
the still existing group of prior corporeal qualities born of the Four Origins 
[22] (kamma, citta, utu, ahara), by way of post-existence, in helping them to 
develop and thrive. For example, the rainwater that falls every subsequent year 
renders service by way of post-existence to such vegetation as has grown up in 
previous years, in promoting its growth and development.</P>
<P>Here, by "every posterior consciousness" are meant all classes of 
consciousness beginning from the first life-continuum to the final 
dying-thought. And, by "prior corporeal qualities" are meant all corporeal 
qualities born of Four Origins starting from the group of material qualities 
born of kamma, which coexist with the rebirth-conception.</P>
<P>The fifteen states of the life-continuum starting serially from the first 
life-continuum, which has arisen after the rebirth-conception, causally relate 
by way of post-existence to the group of material qualities born of kamma, which 
coexist with the rebirth-conception. As to the rebirth-conception, it cannot be 
a causal relation by way of post-existence, for it coexists with the group of 
corporeal qualities born of kamma. Similarly, the sixteenth life-continuum 
cannot become a causal relation by way of post-existence, for it comes into 
existence only when that group of material qualities reaches the stage of 
dissolution. Therefore, these are "the fifteen states of the life-continuum" 
which causally relate as above.</P>
<P>At the static moment of the rebirth-conception, there spring up two groups of 
material qualities, born of kamma, and born of temperature; [23] and the same at 
the arrested moment. But at the nascent moment of the first life-continuum, 
three groups spring up: that born of kamma, that born of temperature, and that 
born of mind. When oja (the nutritive essence) of the food eaten, spreads all 
through the body, the corporeal nutritive</FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua" 
size=4> </FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua">essence absorbs the stimulant, and 
produces a group of material qualities. From that time onward, the groups 
produced by the Four Origins spring up incessantly, like the flame of a burning 
lamp. Leaving out the nascent moment, so long as these groups stand at their 
static stage, every one of the posterior fifteen classes of consciousness 
renders them help by way of post-existence.</P>
<P>Vuddhivirulhiya means "for the gradual development and progress of the series 
of corporeal qualities born of the Four Origins." Therefore, if they, the four 
kinds of corporeal groups, are repeatedly related by (lit., do repeatedly 
obtain) the causal relation of post-existence, then they leave behind them, when 
their physical life-term has expired, a powerful energy--an energy adequate to 
produce the development, progress and prosperity of the subsequent series of 
groups.</P></FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua" size=4>

<H2 align=center>Asevana-Paccaya or the Relation of Habitual 
Recurrence</H2></FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua">
<P>The forty-seven kinds of mundane apperceptions comprising the twelve classes 
of immoral consciousness, the seventeen mundane classes of moral consciousness, 
and the eighteen classes of inoperative consciousness (obtained by excluding the 
two classes of consciousness, called "turning towards", avajjana, from the 
twenty), are here termed the causal relation of habitual recurrence. When any 
one of these arrives at the apperceptional process (i.e., the sequence of seven 
similar states of consciousness in a process of thought) every preceding 
apperception causally relates itself by way of habitual recurrence to every 
succeeding apperception. The related things, paccayuppanna-Dhammas, comprise the 
succeeding apperceptions as stated above, as well as the Four Paths.</P>
<P>In what sense is the term asevana to be understood? It is to be understood in 
the sense of habituating by constant repetition or of causing in its 
paccayuppanna-dhamma to accept its inspiration, for them to gain greater and 
greater proficiency, energy and force. Here Pagunabhava means proficiency of the 
succeeding apperceptional thoughts in their apperceptive functions and stages; 
just as one who reads a lesson many times becomes more proficient with each new 
reading.</P>
<P>Parivaso literally means perfuming, or inspiring. Just as a silk cloth is 
perfumed with sweet scents, so also is the body of thought, so to speak, 
perfumed, or inspired, with lust, hate, and so forth; or with disinterestedness 
(arajjana), amity (adussana), and so on. Although the preceding apperception 
ceases, its apperceptional force does not cease; that is, its force pervades the 
succeeding thought. Therefore, every succeeding apperception, on coming into 
existence, becomes more vigorous on account of the formers habituation. Thus the 
immediate preceding thought habituates or causes its immediate successor to 
accept its habituation. However, the process of habitual recurrence usually 
ceases at the seventh thought, after which, either resultant thought-moments of 
retention follow, or subsidence into the life-continuum takes place.</P>
<P>Here, habitual recurrence, as dealt with in the Suttanta, ought to be 
mentioned also. Many passages are to be found in several parts of the Sutta 
Pitaka. Such are: Satipatthanam bhaveti: "one cultivates the earnest 
applications in mindfulness"; Sammappadhanam bhaveti: "one cultivates the 
supreme effort"; Sati-sambojjhangam bhaveti: "one cultivates mindfulness, a 
factor of Enlightenment"; Dhammavicaya-sambojjhangam bhaveti: "one cultivates 
the "investigation of truth," a factor of Enlightenment"; Sammaditthim bhaveti: 
"one cultivates the right view"; Sammasankappam bhaveti: "one cultivates right 
aspiration". and so on. In these passages, by "bhaveti" is meant, to repeat the 
effort either for one day, or for seven days, or for one month, or for seven 
months, or for one year, or for seven years.</P>
<P>Moral and immoral actions, which have been repeatedly performed or 
cultivated, or many times done in former existences, causally relate by way of 
habitual recurrence to moral and immoral actions of the present existence for 
their greater improvement and worsening respectively.</P>
<P>The relation which effects the improvement and the worsening respectively of 
such moral and immoral actions, at some other distant time or in some future 
existence, is called sufficing condition, but the one which effects this only 
during the apperceptional process is called habitual recurrence.</P>
<P>In this world, there are clearly to be seen always many incidental results or 
consequences following upon great achievements in art, science, literature, and 
so forth, which have been carried out in thought, word, and deed, continuously, 
repeatedly and incessantly.</P>
<P>As such a relation of habitual recurrence is found among all transient 
phenomena, manly zeal and effort, exerted for a long period of time, have 
developed to such a high degree that many great and difficult labors have 
reached complete accomplishment and that even Buddhahood has been 
attained.</P></FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua" size=4>

<H2 align=center>Kamma-Paccaya or the Relationship of Kamma</H2></FONT><FONT 
face="Book Antiqua">
<P>The relation of kamma is of two kinds: coexistent kamma and asynchronous 
kamma.</P>
<P>Of these two, all volitions, moral, immoral, and unmoral, which consist of 
three time-phases, constitute the causal relation of coexistent kamma. Their 
related things are: All classes of consciousness and their mental concomitants 
in coexistence with volition; material qualities born of kamma, which arise 
simultaneously with the rebirth-conception, and material qualities produced by 
mind during the term of life.</P>
<P>Past moral and immoral volitions constitute the causal relation of 
asynchronous kamma. Their related things are the thirty-seven classes of mundane 
resultant consciousness and their mental concomitants, and all the material 
qualities born of kamma.</P>
<P>Why is kamma so called? It is so called on account of its peculiar function. 
This peculiar function is nothing but volition (or will) itself, and it 
dominates every action. When any action of thought, word, or body, takes place, 
volition (or will) determines, fashions, or causes its concomitants to perform 
their respective functions simultaneously. For this reason, volition is said to 
be predominant in all actions. Thus kamma is so called on account of its 
peculiar function. Or, to define it in another way, kamma is that by which 
creatures do (or act). What do they do then? They do physical work, vocal work, 
and mental work. Here, by "physical work" is meant standing, sitting, and so 
forth; stepping forward and backward, and so on; and even the</FONT><FONT 
face="Book Antiqua" size=4> </FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua">opening and the 
shutting of the eyelids. Vocal work means producing vocal sounds. Mental work 
means thinking wisely or badly, and, in short, the functions of seeing, hearing, 
and so forth, with the five senses. Thus all the actions of beings are 
determined by this volition. Therefore it is called kamma.</P>
<P>Sahajata is that which comes into being simultaneously with its related 
things. Sahajatakamma is a coexistent thing as well as a kamma. 
Sahajatakamma-paccaya is a causal relation standing (to its effects) by way of 
coexistent kamma.</P>
<P>Nanakkhanikam is a thing differing in point of time from its effects. That is 
to say, the time when the volition arises is one, and the time when its effects 
take place is another; or, in other words, the volition is asynchronous. Hence 
asynchronous volition is a volition that differs in point of time from its 
effects. So Nanakkhanikakammapaccaya is a causal relation standing (to its 
effects) by way of asynchronous kamma. The volition which coexists with the 
Aryan Path,</FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua" size=4> </FONT><FONT 
face="Book Antiqua">only at the moment of its ceasing, immediately produces its 
effect, and so it also is asynchronous.</P>
<P>Here, a moral volition such as predominates in charity, for instance, is 
causally related to its coexistent mind and mental qualities, together with the 
material qualities produced by the same mind, by way of coexistent kamma. It is 
also causally related, by way of asynchronous kamma, to the resultant aggregates 
of mind and material qualities born of that kamma, which will be brought into 
existence at a distant period in the future. Thus a volition, which is 
transmuted into a course of action entailing moral and immoral consequences, is 
causally related to its related things by way of two such different relations at 
two different times.</P>
<P>In this asynchronous kamma relation, the kamma signifies quite a peculiar 
energy. It does not cease though the volition ceases, but latently follows the 
sequences of mind. As soon as it obtains a favorable opportunity, it takes 
effect immediately after the dying-thought has ceased, by transmuting itself 
into the form of an individual in the immediately following existence. But, if 
it does not obtain any favorable opportunity, it remains in the same latent mode 
for many hundreds of existences. If it obtains a favorable opportunity, then 
what is called "sublime kamma" takes effect, upon the next existence in the 
Brahma-loka, by transmuting itself into the form of a Brahma-deva, and it is so 
matured that it exhausts itself at the end of this second existence, and does 
not go any further.</P></FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua" size=4>

<H2 align=center>Vipaka-Paccaya or the Relation of Effect</H2></FONT><FONT 
face="Book Antiqua">
<P>Thirty-six classes of resultant consciousness and their concomitants are the 
relation of effect. As they are mutually related to one another, the related 
things embrace all of them, as well as the material qualities born of kamma at 
the time of conception, and those produced by the resultant consciousness during 
life.</P>
<P>In what sense is vipaka applied? It is applied in the sense of vipaccana, 
which means a change of state from infancy or youth to maturity. Whose 
tenderness and maturity are meant? What is meant of the former is the infancy of 
the past volition, which is known as asynchronous kamma. By maturity, also, is 
meant the maturity of the same kamma.</P>
<P>Here, it should be understood that each volition has four avatthas, or 
time-phases--cetanavattha, or the genesis of volition; kammavattha, or the 
continuance of volition; nimittavattha, or the representation of volition, and 
vipakavattha, or the final result. Here, although the volition itself ceases, 
its peculiar function does not cease, but latently follows the series of 
thought. This is called kammavattha, or the continuance of volition.</P>
<P>When it obtains a favorable opportunity for fruition, the kamma represents 
itself to the person about to die. That is to say, he himself feels as if he 
were giving charity, or observing the precepts, or perhaps killing some 
creatures. If this kamma fails to represent itself, a symbol of it is 
represented. That is to say, he himself feels as if he were in possession of the 
offerings, the gifts, the weapons, and so on; or any thing with which he had 
committed such kamma in the past. Or, sometimes, there is represented to him the 
sign of the next existence where he is destined to open his new life. That is to 
say, such objects as the abodes or palaces of the Devas, or the fires of the 
Niraya-worlds, or what-not, which--as it will be his lot to obtain, or to 
experience, such in the existence immediately following--enter the fields of 
presentation through the six doors. These are called nimittavattha, the 
representation, of the volition.</P>
<P>Now, how are we to understand the vipakavattha? If a person dies with his 
attention fixed upon one of these three classes of</FONT><FONT 
face="Book Antiqua" size=4> </FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua">objects, either on 
the kamma itself or on the sign of it, or on the sign of destiny, it is said 
that kamma has effected itself, or has come to fruition, in the immediately new 
existence. It has transmuted itself into a personality, and appears, so to 
speak, in the form of a being in the new existence. This is called the 
vipakavattha, or the final result. Here, in the first three avatthas, the 
volition is said to be in the state of infancy or youth. [24] The last one shows 
that the volition has arrived in maturity, and can effect itself. Therefore, as 
has been said, vipaccana means a change of state from infancy or youth to 
maturity. Thus vipaka is the name assigned to the states of consciousness and 
their concomitants, which are the results of the volitions, or to the matured 
volitions themselves.</P>
<P>Just as mangoes are very soft and delicate when they are ripe, so also the 
resultant states are very tranquil, since they are</FONT><FONT 
face="Book Antiqua" size=4> </FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua">inactive and have 
no stimulus. They are so tranquil that the objects of sub-consciousness are 
always dim and obscure. On reviving from sub-consciousness, one has no 
consciousness of what its object was. For this reason, there is no possibility 
of occurrence of a process of thought, which can reflect the object of the 
sub-consciousness thus: "Such and such an object has been met with in the past 
existence"--although, in sleep at night, the sub-consciousness takes for its 
object one of the three classes of objects (kamma, the symbols of kamma, and the 
symbols of ones future destiny), which had been experienced before, at the time 
of approaching death, in the immediately preceding existence. Hence, it is, that 
one knows nothing about any object from a past existence, either in sleep or in 
waking. Thus the mutual relationship by way of inactivity, non-stimulation, and 
tranquility, is termed the function of Vipaka.</P></FONT><FONT

<H2 align=center>Ahara-Paccaya or the Relation of Food</H2></FONT><FONT 
face="Book Antiqua">
<P>The relation of food is of two kinds: material and immaterial. Of these, 
material food connotes the nutritive essence (or what is called edible food), 
which again is subdivided into two kinds: internal and external.</P>
<P>All the natural qualities born of the Four Causes, [25] pertaining to those 
creatures that live on edible food, are here the paccayuppanna-Dhammas related 
to the two kinds of material food.</P>
<P>As to immaterial food, it is of three different kinds: contact, volitional 
activity of mind, and consciousness. These kinds of immaterial food, or paccaya 
Dhammas are causally related to the coexistent properties, both mental and 
material, which are their corresponding paccayuppanna-dhamma.</P>
<P>In what sense is ahara to be understood? Ahara is to be understood in the 
sense of 'holding up strongly', which means "causing to exist firmly". That is 
to say, a relating thing nourishes its related thing so as to enable it to 
endure long, to develop, to flourish, and to thrive, by means of support. Though 
the causal relation of food possesses a producing power, the power of support is 
predominant here.</P>
<P>Here, the two material foods are called ahara, because they strongly hold up 
the group of internal material qualities born of the Four Causes, by nourishing 
them so that they may exist firmly, endure long, and reach un-curtailed the 
bounds (or limits) of their life-term.</P>
<P>Contact is an ahara also, because it strongly holds up its coexistent things, 
and enables them to stand firmly and endure long by</FONT><FONT 
face="Book Antiqua" size=4> </FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua">nourishing them 
with the essence extracted from desirable and undesirable objects. Volitional 
activity of mind, or (in a word) will, is an ahara in that it furnishes courage 
for the execution of deeds, words, and thoughts. And consciousness is an ahara 
also, inasmuch as it predominates in all thinking about an object. These three 
immaterial foods, in supplying nourishment to the coexistent mentals, also 
affect the coexistent materials.</P>
<P>Ahara here may also be explained after the Suttanta method. Just as birds, 
ascertaining where their quarters are, fly with</FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua" 
size=4> </FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua">their wings through the air from tree 
to tree and from wood to wood, and peck at fruits with their beaks, thus 
sustaining themselves through their whole life, so also beings--with the six 
classes of consciousness, ascertaining objects; with the six kinds of volitional 
activity of mind, persevering to get something as an object; and with the six 
kinds of contact, making the essence of objects appear--either enjoy pleasure or 
suffer pain. Or, solely with the six classes of consciousness, comprehending 
objects, they avail themselves of forming, or becoming, body and mind. Or, 
solely with the contacts, making objects appear in order that feelings may be 
aroused through the same, they cultivate craving. Or, committing various kinds 
of deeds through craving accompanied by volitions, they migrate (so to speak) 
from existence to existence. Thus should be understood how extensive the 
functioning of the different foods is.</P></FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua"

<H2 align=center>Indriya-Paccaya or the Relation of Control</H2></FONT><FONT 
face="Book Antiqua">
<P>The relation of control is of three kinds, namely coexistence, pre-existence 
and physical life.</P>
<P>Of these, the paccaya-Dhammas of the first kind [26] are the fifteen 
coexistent controls, namely, psychic life, consciousness, pleasure, pain, joy, 
grief, hedonic indifference, faith, energy,</FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua" 
size=4> </FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua">mindfulness, concentration, reason, the 
thought: "I-shall-come-to-know-the-unknown (Nibbána)", the thought: "I-know", 
and the thought: "I-have-known". The paccayuppanna-Dhammas are their coexistent 
properties, both mental and material.</P>
<P>The paccaya-Dhammas of the second kind are the five sentient organs: the eye, 
the ear, the nose, the tongue and the body. The paccayupanna-Dhammas are the 
five senses together with their concomitants.</P>
<P>The paccaya-Dhammas of the third kind is only one, namely, physical life 
itself. And all kamma-born material qualities, with the exception of physical 
life itself, are its paccayuppanna-Dhammas.</P>
<P>In what sense is indriya to be understood? It is to be understood in the 
sense of "exercising control over". Over what does it exercise control? It 
exercises control over its paccayuppanna-Dhammas. In what function? In their 
respective functions. Psychic life exercises control over its coexistent mental 
properties in infusing life, that is, in the matter of their prolongation by 
continuity. Consciousness exercises control in the matter of thinking about an 
object. The functioning of the rest has been explained in our recent 
Indriya-Yamaka-Dipani.</P>
<P>Here, some may put a question like this: "Why are the two sexes [27] --the 
female and the male--which are comprised in the category of controls, not taken 
in this relation as paccaya-Dhammas?" The answer is: Because they have none of 
the functions of a paccaya. A paccaya has three kinds of functioning, namely, 
producing, supporting and maintaining. Here, if A is causally related to B in 
Bs arising, As functioning is said to be that of producing, for had A not 
occurred, the arising of B would have been impossible. The functioning of 
Anantara may be instanced here. Again, if A is causally related to B in Bs 
existence, development and prosperity, As functioning is said to be that of 
supporting, for if A did not</FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua" size=4> 
</FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua">happen B would not stand, develop and flourish. 
The relation of Pacchajata will serve here as an example. And, if A is causally 
related to B in Bs prolongation by continuity, As</FONT><FONT 
face="Book Antiqua" size=4> </FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua">functioning is said 
to be that of maintaining, for if A did not exist, Bs prolongation would be 
hampered, and its continuity would also be broken. The functioning of physical 
life will illustrate this.</P>
<P>Now, the two sexes do not execute any one of the said three functions. 
Therefore, they are not taken as a paccaya-Dhamma in this relation of control. 
If this be so, must they still be called controls? Yes, they must be called 
controls. Why? Because they have something of controlling power. They control 
the body in its sexual structure (linga), in its appearance (nimitta), in its 
characters (kutta), and in its outward dispositions (akappa). Therefore, at the 
period of conception, if the female sex is produced in a being, all its 
personality, i.e. the five aggregates produced by the Four Causes (kamma, and so 
forth), tends towards femininity. The whole body, indeed, displays nothing but 
the feminine structure, the feminine appearance, the feminine character, and the 
feminine outward disposition. Here, neither does the female sex produce those 
qualities, nor support, nor maintain them. But, in fact, when the body (i e. the 
five aggregates) has come into existence, the sex exercises control over it as 
if it (sex) were giving it the order to become so and so. All the aggregates 
also become in conformity with the sex, and not out of conformity. Such is the 
controlling power of the female sex in the feminine structure. In the same 
manner the male sex exercises control in the masculine structure. Thus the two 
sexes have controlling functions in the structures, hence they may" be called 
controls.</P>
<P>With regard to the heart-basis, though it acts as a basis for the two 
elements of mind-cognition, it does not control them in any way. For, whether 
the heart is limpid or not, the elements of mind-cognition in a person of 
well-trained mind never conform to it.</P></FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua"

<H2 align=center>Jhana-Paccaya or the Relation Of Jhana</H2></FONT><FONT 
face="Book Antiqua">
<P>The seven constituents of jhana are the paccaya-Dhammas in the relation of 
jhana. They are: vitakka (initial application), vicara (sustained application), 
piti (pleasurable interest, somanassa (joy), domanassa (grief), upekkha (hedonic 
indifference) and ekaggata (concentration in the sense of capacity to 
individualize). All classes of consciousness (with the exception of the five 
senses), their concomitants and material qualities in coexistence with the seven 
constituents, are the paccayuppanna-Dhammas here.</P>
<P>In what sense is jhana to be understood? Jhana is to be understood in the 
sense of closely viewing or actively looking at; that is to say, going close to 
the object and looking at it mentally. Just as an archer--who from a distance is 
able to send or thrust an arrow into the bulls eye of a small target--holding 
the arrow firmly in his hand, making it steady, directing it towards the mark, 
keeping the target in view, and attentively</FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua" 
size=4> </FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua">looking, or rather aiming at it, sends 
the arrow through the bulls eye or thrusts it into the latter, so also, in 
speaking of a yogi or one who practices jhana, we must say that he, directing 
his mind towards the object, making it steadfast, and keeping the kasina-object 
in view, thrusts his mind into it by means of these seven constituents of jhana. 
Thus, by closely viewing them, a person carries out his action of body, of word, 
and mind, without failure. Here, "action of body" means going forward and 
backward and so forth; "action of word" means making vocal expressions, such as 
the sounds of alphabets, words and so forth; action of mind" means being 
conscious of Objects of any kind. So no deed, such as giving charity or taking 
life can be executed by a feeble mind lacking the necessary constituents of 
jhana. It is the same with all moral and immoral deeds</P>
<P>To have a clear understanding of its meaning the salient characteristic mark 
of each constituent of jhana should be separately explained. Vitakka has the 
characteristic mark of directing the concomitant properties towards the object, 
and it, therefore, fixes the mind firmly to the object. Vicara has the 
characteristic mark of reviewing the object over and over, and it attaches the 
mind firmly to the object. Piti has the characteristic mark of creating interest 
in the object, and makes the mind happy and content with it. The three kinds of 
vedana, i.e. joy, grief and indifference, have the characteristic marks of 
feeling the object, and they also fasten the mind as regards experiencing the 
essence of desirable, undesirable and neutral objects. Ekaggata has the 
characteristic mark of concentration and it also keeps the mind steadfastly 
fixed on the object.</P></FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua" size=4>

<H2 align=center>Magga-Paccaya or the Relation of Path</H2></FONT><FONT 
face="Book Antiqua">
<P>The twelve path-constituents are the paccaya-Dhammas in this relation of 
Magga. They are: -- Right Views, Right Aspiration, Right Speech, Right Action, 
Right Livelihood, Right Endeavor, Right Mindfulness, Right Concentration, Wrong 
Views, Wrong Aspiration, Wrong Endeavor, and Wrong Concentration. There are, 
however, no distinct mental properties to which to assign the terms Wrong 
Speech, Wrong Action and Wrong Livelihood. These are but other names for the 
four immoral aggregates (akusala-khandha), which appear under the names of lying 
and so forth. Therefore they are not taken as distinct path-constituents. All 
classes of consciousness and mental concomitants conditioned by hetu, and all 
material qualities in coexistence with the hetu-conditioned mind are 
paccayuppanna-Dhammas.</P>
<P>In what sense is magga to be understood? It is to be understood in the sense 
of path, that is, as the means of reaching the realm of misfortune or the realm 
of Nibbána. The eight path-constituents (Right Views, and so on) lead to 
Nibbána. The four wrong path-constituents lead to the realm of misfortune.</P>
<P>Now the functioning of jhana is to make the mind straight, steadfast, and 
ecstatic [28] in the object. "Ecstatic mind" means mind that sinks into the 
kasina-object, and so forth, like a fish in deep water. The functioning of magga 
is to make kammic volition in the "way-in" to the circle of existence and 
bhavanic volition in the "way-out" of the circle, straight and steadfast, issue 
in a course of action, develop, flourish and prosper, and reach a higher plane. 
This is the distinction between the two relations.</P>
<P>Here, the kammic volition, which can produce a rebirth--since it has worked 
out in moral and immoral acts such as taking life, and so forth is spoken of as 
kammapathapatta. And the bhavanic volition, which arrives at the higher stages, 
that is, proceeds from the sensuous stage to the transcendental one, through a 
succession of higher and higher stages, by the power of an orderly succession of 
training-practices (bhavananukamma), even within the brief period occupied by 
one bodily posture, is spoken of as bhummantarapatta.</P>
<P>To understand this relation, the characteristic mark of each of the 
path-constituents should also be separately explained in the manner shown in the 
Relation of Jhana.</P>

<P>The relations of association and dissociation form a pair. So also do the 
relations of presence and absence, and of abeyance and continuance. These three 
pairs of relations are not special ones. They are only mentioned to show that, 
in the foregoing relations, some paccaya-Dhammas causally relate themselves to 
their paccayuppanna-Dhammas, by association, and others by dissociation; some by 
presence and others by absence; some by abeyance and others by continuance.</P>
<P>Here also in such passages as: "Atthi ti kho, kaccana, ayam eko anto; natthi 
ti kho dutiyo anto ti", [29] the words atthi and natthi are meant to indicate 
the heretical views of Eternalism and Annihilationism. Therefore, in order to 
prevent such interpretations, the last pair of relations is mentioned.</P>
<P>All classes of consciousness and mental properties mutually relate themselves 
to one another by way of association. In what sense is "sampayutta" to be 
understood? "Sampayutta" is to be understood in the sense of association, or 
through coalescence, by the four associative means, namely, simultaneous 
arising, synchronous cessation, mono-basic, and mono-object. Here, by ekibhavam 
gato (or coalescence), it is meant that the consciousness of sight coalesces 
with its seven mental properties so thoroughly that they all are unitedly spoken 
of as sight. These eight mental states are no longer spoken of by their special 
names, for it is indeed a difficult matter to know them</FONT><FONT

four, the paccaya and paccayuppanna-Dhammas of the coexistent dissociation may 
be either mental or physical in accordance with what has been shown in the 
relation of coexistence. Therefore a mental is causally related to a physical by 
way of coexistent dissociation, and vice versa. A "mental" here, when spoken of 
as a paccaya, means the four mental aggregates, namely, sensation, perception, 
mental functionings and, consciousness, during life; and a "physical" when 
spoken of as paccayuppanna, means material qualities produced by mind. Again a 
"physical" when spoken of as a paccaya, means the heart-basis at the moment of 
conception, and a "mental", when spoken of as paccayuppanna means the four 
mental aggregates belonging to rebirth.</P>

face="Book Antiqua">
<P>The synthesis of relations will now be stated.</P>
<P>The relation of sahajata (coexistence) may be specified as being of fifteen 
kinds, i.e. four superior sahajatas, four medium sahajatas, and seven inferior 
sahajatas. The four superior sahajatas comprise ordinary sahajata, 
sahajatanissaya (dependence-in-coexistence), sahajatatthi (coexistent presence), 
and sahajata-avigata (coexistent continuance). The four medium sahajatas 
comprise annamanna (reciprocity), vipaka (effect), sampayutta (association), and 
sahajata-vippayutta (coexistent dissociation). The seven inferior sahajata 
comprise hetu (condition), sahajata-dhipati (coexistent dominance), 
sahajata-kamma (coexistent kamma), sahajathara (coexistent food), sahajatindriya 
(coexistent control), jhana, and magga (way).</P>
<P>Rupahara, or material food is of three kinds: rupahara (ordinary material 
food), rupaharatthi, and rupaharavigata.</P>
<P>Rupa-jivitindriya, or physical life-control is of three kinds: 
rupa-jivitindriya, jivitindriyatthi, and rupa-jivitindriya-avigata.</P>
<P>The relation of purejata (pre-existence) may be specified as seventeen kinds: 
six vatthu-purejatas (basic pre-existence), six arammana-purejatas (objective 
pre-existence), and five vattharammana-purejatas (basic objective 
pre-existence). Of these, the six vatthu-purejatas are vatthu-purejata, 
vatthupurejatanissaya, vatthu-purejatindriya, vatthu-purejata-vippayutta, 
vatthu-purejatatthi, and vatthu-purejata-avigata. The six arammana-purejatas 
are: arammana-purejata, some arammana, some arammanadhipati, some 
arammana-arammanupanissaya, arammana-purejatatthi, and 
arammana-purejata-avigata. The words "kinci" and "koci" in kinci arammanam and 
so forth are used in order to take in only the present nipphanna-rupas (material 
qualities determined by kamma and environments). The five vattharammana-purejata 
are vattharammana-purejata, vattharammanapurejata-nissaya, 
vattharammana-purejata-vippayutta, vattharammana-purejatatthi, and 
vattharammana-purejata-avigata.</P>
<P>The relation of pacchajata or post-existence may be specified as four kinds: 
pacchajata, pacchajata-vippayutta, pacchajatatthi, and pacchajata-avigata.</P>
<P>The relation of anantara (contiguity) is of seven kinds: anantara, 
samanantara, anantarapanissaya, asevana, anatara-kamma, natthi, and vigata. Of 
these, anantara kamma is the volition, which appertains to the Aryan Path. It 
produces its effect, i.e. the Aryan Fruit, immediately after it ceases.</P>
<P>There are five relations, which do not enter into any specification. These 
are: the remaining arammana, the remaining arammanadhipati, the remaining 
arammanupanissaya, all pakatupanissaya, and the remaining kind of kamma, which 
is asynchronous kamma.</P>
<P>Thus, the relations expounded in the Great Treatise (Patthana) are altogether 
fifty-four kinds in all.</P>
<P>Of these relations, all species of purejata, all species of pacchajata, 
material food, and physical life-control are present relations. All species of 
anantara and of nanakkhanika kamma are past relations. Omitting Nibbána and 
term-and-concept, pannatti--the relations of arammana and pakatupanissaya may be 
classified under the three periods of time: past, present and future. But 
Nibbána and term-and-concept are always outside time.</P>
<P>These two Dhammas--Nibbána and pannatti (concept)--are both termed appaccaya 
(void of causal relation), asankhata (unconditioned). [30] Why? Because they are 
absolutely void of Becoming. Those things or phenomena, which have birth or 
genesis are termed sappaccaya (related things), sankhata (conditioned things), 
and paticcasamuppannas (things arising from a conjuncture of circumstances). 
Hence those two Dhammas, being void of becoming and happening, are truly to be 
termed appaccayas and asankhatas.</P>
<P>Among things related and conditioned, there is not a single phenomenon, which 
is permanent, lasting, eternal and unchangeable. In fact, all are impermanent, 
since they are liable to dissolution. Why? Because, in coming into existence, 
they are related to some causes, and their causes are also not permanent. Are 
not Nibbána and concept paccaya-Dhammas or relating things? Are they not 
permanent and lasting? Yes, they are so, but no phenomenon happens entirely 
through Nibbána or concept alone as sole cause. Phenomena happen through, or are 
produced by, many causes, which are not permanent and lasting.</P>
<P>Those things, which are not permanent, are always distressing and hurtful to 
beings with the three kinds of afflictions. Therefore, they are looked upon as 
ill by reason of their being dreadful. Here the three kinds of afflictions are 
"dukkha-dukkhata" (ill due to suffering), "sankhárá-dukkhata" (ill due to 
conditioning), and "viparinama-dukkhata" (ill due to changeability). All things 
are impermanent, and are dissolving at every moment, even while occupying one 
posture. [31] Therefore, how can there be any essential self or core in 
creatures and persons, even though, all their life through, they imagine 
themselves to be permanent? Everything is also subject to ill. Therefore, how 
can there be any essential self or core in creatures and persons who are under 
the oppression of ills, and who nevertheless yearn for happiness? Hence all 
things are void of self by reason of the absence of a core.</P>
<P>To sum up, by expounding the twenty-four relations, the Buddha reveals the 
following facts: all conditioned things owe their happenings and becoming or 
existence to causes and conditions, and none to the mere desire or will or 
command of creatures. And among all the things subject to causes and conditions, 
there is not one that comes into being through few causes; they arise, indeed, 
only through many. Therefore, this exposition reaches its culminating point in 
revealing the doctrine of No self or No-soul.</P></FONT><FONT

<H2 align=center>Paccaya-Ghatananaya or the Synchrony of 
Relations</H2></FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua">
<P>The synchrony of relations will now be stated.</P>
<P>The concurrence of causal relations in one related thing is called synchrony 
of relations or paccaya-ghatana. All phenomena are called sa-paccaya (related to 
causes), sankhata (conditioned by causes), and paticcasamuppanna (arising from a 
conjuncture of</FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua" size=4> </FONT><FONT 
face="Book Antiqua">circumstances), because in arising and in standing they 
coexist with, or have, or are conditioned by, these twenty-four causal 
relations. What then are those phenomena? They are: one hundred and twenty-one 
classes of consciousness, fifty-two kinds of mental properties, and twenty-eight 
kinds of material qualities.</P>
<P>Of these, the one hundred and twenty-one classes of consciousness may be 
classified into seven, under the category of dhatu (elements):</P>
<P>Element of visual cognition</P>
<P>Element of auditory cognition</P>
<P>Element of olfactory cognition</P>
<P>Element of gustatory cognition</P>
<P>Element of tactile cognition</P>
<P>Element of apprehension</P>
<P>Element of comprehension.</P>
<P>Of these:</P>
<P>The two-fold classes of sight-consciousness are called the elements of visual 
cognition;</P>
<P>The two-fold classes of sound-consciousness are called the elements of 
auditory cognition;</P>
<P>The two-fold classes of smell-consciousness are called the elements of 
olfactory cognition;</P>
<P>The two-fold classes of taste-consciousness are called the elements of 
gustatory cognition;</P>
<P>The two-fold classes of touch-consciousness are called the elements of 
tactile cognition;</P>
<P>"The adverting of mind towards any of the five doors" (pancadvaravajjana) and 
the two-fold classes of "acceptance of impressions" (sampaticchana) are called 
the elements of apprehension;</P>
<P>The remaining one hundred and eight classes of consciousness are called the 
elements of comprehension.</P>
<P>The fifty-two kinds of mental properties are also divided into groups:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Seven universals</P>
<P>Six particulars</P>
<P>Fourteen immorals</P>
<P>Twenty-five radiants.</P>
<P>Of the twenty-four relations:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Fifteen relations are common to all the mental states: arammana, anantara, 
samanantara, sahajata, annamanna, nissaya, upanissaya, kamma, ahara, indriya, 
sampayutta, atthi, natthi, vigata and avigata.</P>
<P>There is not a single class of consciousness or mental property, which arises 
without the causal relation of arammana (object). The same holds good as regards 
the remaining causal relations of anantara, samanantara, sahajata and so on.</P>
<P>Eight relations only--hetu, adhipati, purejata, asevana, vipaka, jhana, magga 
and vippayutta--are common to some mental states. Of these, the relation of hetu 
is common only to the classes of consciousness conditioned by hetu; the relation 
of adhipati is also common only to the apperceptions (javanas) coexisting with 
dominance (adhipati); the relation of purejata is common only to some classes of 
mind; the relation of asevana is common only to apperceptive classes of moral, 
immoral, and inoperative consciousness; the relation of vipaka is also common 
only to the resultant classes of mind; the relation of jhana is common to those 
classes of consciousness and mental concomitants which come under the name of 
elements of apprehension and comprehension; the relation of magga is common to 
the classes of mind conditioned by hetu; the relation of vippayutta is not 
common to the classes of mind in arupaloka. Only one particular relation of 
pacchajata is common to material qualities.</P>
<P>Here is the exposition in detail. The seven universal, mental properties are: 
phassa (contact), vedana (sensation), sañña (perception), cetana (volition), 
ekaggata (concentration in its capacity to individualize), jivita (psychic life) 
and manasikara (attention).</P>
<P>Of these, consciousness may be the relation of adhipati; it may be the 
relation of ahara, and it may also be the relation of indriya; contact is the 
relation of ahara alone; sensation may be the relation of indriya, and may also 
be the relation of jhana; volition may be the relation of kamma, and may be the 
relation of ahara; ekaggata may be the relation of indriya; it may be the 
relation of jhana; and it may be the relation of magga also; psychic life is the 
relation of indriya alone; the two remaining states--perception and 
attention--do not become any particular relation.</P>
<P>Consciousness by way of sight, obtains seven universal mental concomitants, 
and so they make up eight mental states. All of them are mutually related to one 
another by way of the seven relations: four superior sahajata and three of the 
medium sahajatas excluding the relation of dissociation. Among these eight 
mental states, consciousness causally relates itself to the other seven by way 
of</FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua" size=4> </FONT><FONT 
face="Book Antiqua">ahara and indriya. Contact causally relates itself to the 
other seven by way of ahara; feeling to the rest by way of indriya alone; 
volition, by way of kamma and ahara; ekaggata, by way of indriya alone; and 
psychic life to the other seven, by way of indriya. The basis of eye causally 
relates itself to these eight states by way of six species of vatthupurejata. 
The present visual objects, which enter the avenue of that eye-base, causally 
relate themselves to those eight by way of four species of arammana purejata. 
Consciousness, which is called turning-towards-the-five-doors at the moment of 
cessation, just before the arising of sight consciousness, causally relates 
itself to these eight mental states by way of five species of anantara. Moral 
and immoral deeds, which were done in former births, causally relate themselves 
to these eight resultant states of good and evil</FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua" 
size=4> </FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua">respectively, by way of asynchronous 
kamma. Nescience (avijja), craving (tanha) and grasping (upadana)--which 
co-operated with volition (kamma) in the past existence, and dwellings, persons, 
seasons, foods and so forth, of this present life, causally relate themselves to 
these eight states by way of pakatupanissaya (natural sufficing condition). The 
six relations-hetu, adhipati, pacchajata, asevana, jhana and magga--do not take 
part in this class of consciousness, but only the remaining eighteen relations 
take part. Just as the six relations do not take part--and only the eighteen 
relations do--in consciousness by way of sight, so do they in consciousness by 
way of hearing, smell, and so on.</P></FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua" size=4>

<H2 align=center>Synchrony of Relations in Consciousness not Accompanied by 
Hetu</H2></FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua">
<P>There are six mental properties termed Particulars (pakinnaka),-- vitakka 
(initial application), vicara (sustained application), adhimokkha (deciding), 
viriya (effort), piti (pleasurable interest), chanda (desire-to-do). Of these, 
initial application takes part in the relation of jhana and in the relation of 
magga. Sustained application takes part in that of jhana alone. Effort takes 
part in the relation of adhipati, in the relation of indriya, and in the 
relation of magga. Pleasurable interest takes part in the relation of jhana. 
Desire-to-do takes part in the relation of adhipati. Deciding does not take part 
in any particular relation.</P>
<P>The ten concomitants, namely, seven universals, initial application, 
sustained application, and deciding from the particulars--obtain in the five 
classes of consciousness, i.e. turning-towards-the-five-doors, the twofold class 
of acceptance, and the twofold class of investigation accompanied by hedonic 
indifference. They form eleven mental states in one combination. Jhanic function 
obtains in these three classes of consciousness. Sensation, ekaggata, initial 
application, and sustained application perform the function of jhana relation. 
Consciousness (turning-towards-the-five-doors) belongs to the inoperative class, 
and so does not obtain in the relation of vipaka. Asynchronous kamma serves in 
place of upanissaya. So, leaving out jhana from, and inserting vipaka in, the 
relations which have been shown above as not obtainable in the five senses, 
there are also six unobtainable and eighteen obtainable in the consciousness, 
turning-towards-the-five-doors.</FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua" size=4> 
</FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua">As for the remaining four resultant classes of 
consciousness, by omitting vipaka, five relations are unobtainable, and, by 
adding vipaka and jhana, nineteen are obtainable.</P>
<P>Investigating consciousness accompanied by joy, obtains eleven mental 
concomitants, namely, the above ten together with pleasurable interest. With the 
consciousness (turning-towards-the-mind-door), eleven concomitants coexist, and 
they are accompanied by effort. They make up twelve mental states together with 
the consciousness. Twelve concomitants, i.e. the above ten together with 
pleasurable interest and effort, coexist with the consciousness of aesthetic 
pleasure. They make up thirteen mental states in combination with the 
consciousness. Of the three classes of investigating consciousness, the one 
accompanied by joy has one more mental property (i.e. pleasurable interest) than 
the other two, in respect of the jhana factors: therefore, the unobtainable five 
and the obtainable nineteen relations are the same as in the two classes of 
investigating consciousness accompanied by hedonic indifference. In the 
consciousness (turning-towards-the-mind-door), the predominant property is 
merely "effort", which performs the functions of indriya and jhana, but not the 
functions of adhipati and magga. This consciousness, being of the inoperative 
class, does not obtain the vipaka relation. Therefore, the unobtainable six 
including vipaka, and the obtainable eighteen including jhana, are the same as 
in the consciousness (turning-towards-the-five-doors). The relation of vipaka is 
also not obtained in the consciousness of aesthetic pleasure, since it belongs 
to the inoperative class. But being an apperceptive class, it obtains in the 
relation of asevana. Therefore, five relations, including vipaka, are not 
obtainable, and nineteen relations including asevana, are 
obtainable.</P></FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua" size=4>

<H2 align=center>Synchrony of Relations in the Immoral Class of 
Consciousness</H2></FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua">
<P>There are twelve classes of immoral consciousness: two rooted in nescience, 
eight rooted in appetite, and two rooted in hate. There are fourteen immoral 
mental properties: moha (dullness), ahirika (shamelessness), anottappa 
(recklessness of consequences), and uddhacca (distraction)--these four are 
termed the moha-quadruple; lobha (greed), ditthi (error), and mana 
(conceit)--these three are termed the lobha-triple; dosa (hate), issa (envy), 
macchariya (selfishness), and kukkucca (worry)--these four are termed the 
dosa-quadruple; thina (sloth), middha (torpor), and vicikiccha 
(perplexity)--these three are termed the pakinnaka triple. Of these, the three 
roots--greed, hate, and dullness--are hetu relations. Error is a magga relation. 
The remaining ten mental properties do not become</FONT><FONT 
face="Book Antiqua" size=4> </FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua">any particular 
relation.</P>
<P>Here, the two classes of consciousness rooted in dullness are: consciousness 
conjoined with perplexity, and consciousness conjoined with distraction. With 
the first of these two, fifteen mental concomitants coexist. There are the seven 
universals, initial application, sustained application, effort (from the 
particulars), the moha-quadruple, and perplexity (from the immorals). They make 
up sixteen mental states in combination with consciousness. In this 
consciousness, i.e. the consciousness conjoined with perplexity, the relations 
of hetu and magga are also obtained. That is, dullness acts as the hetu 
relation; initial application and effort as the magga; and, as to ekaggata, as 
its function would be interfered with by perplexity, it does not perform the 
functions of indriya and magga, but it does the function of jhana. Therefore, 
the three relations (adhipati, pacchajata, vipaka) are not obtainable; and the 
remaining twenty-one are obtainable in this consciousness, which is conjoined 
with perplexity.</P>
<P>In consciousness conjoined with distraction, there are also fifteen mental 
properties--omitting "perplexity" and adding "deciding". They also make up 
sixteen mental states together with the consciousness. In this consciousness, 
ekaggata performs the functions of indriya, jhana and magga. Therefore, three 
relations are not obtainable, whereas twenty-one are obtainable.</P>
<P>Seven universals, six particulars, the moha-quadruple, the lobha-triple, 
sloth and torpor--altogether twenty-two in number, severally coexist with the 
eight classes of consciousness rooted in appetite. Among these, the two 
roots--greed and dullness--are hetu relations; and the three mental 
states--desire-to-do, consciousness itself and effort--are adhipati relations. 
Arammanadhipati is also obtained here. Volition is the relation of kamma. The 
three foods are the relations of ahara. The five mental states: mind, sensation, 
ekaggata, psychic life and effort--are relations of indriya. The five jhana 
factors, i.e. initial</FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua" size=4> </FONT><FONT 
face="Book Antiqua">application, sustained application, pleasurable interest, 
sensation, concentration, are jhana relations. The four magga constituents, i.e.

<P>There are ninety-one "radiant" classes of consciousness. They are: twenty 
four "radiant" classes of kama-consciousness, fifteen classes of 
rupa-consciousness, twelve classes of arupa-consciousness and forty classes of 
transcendental consciousness. Of these the twenty-four "radiant" classes of 
kama-consciousness are: eight classes of moral consciousness, eight classes of 
"radiant" resultant kind, and another eight classes of "radiant" inoperative 
kind.</P>
<P>There are twenty-five kinds of sobhana ("radiant") mental properties: alobha 
(disinterestedness), adosa (amity), amoha (intelligence)--these three are termed 
moral hetus--saddha (faith), sati (mindfulness), hiri (prudence), ottappa 
(discretion), tatramajhattata (balance of mind), kayapassaddhi (composure of 
mental properties), cittapassaddhi (composure, of mind), kaya-lahuta (buoyancy 
of mental properties), citta-lahuta (buoyancy of mind), kayamuduta (pliancy of 
mental</FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua" size=4> </FONT><FONT

(fitness of work of mental properties), citta-kammannata (fitness of work of

(proficiency of mind), kayujukata (rectitude of mental properties), cittujukata, 
(rectitude of mind), samma-vaca (right speech), samma-kammanta (right action), 
samma-ajiva (right livelihood)--the last three are called the three abstinences; 
karuna (compassion) and mudita (sympathetic appreciation)--these last two are 
called the two illimitables.</P>
<P>Of these, the three moral hetu are hetupaccayas. Intelligence appears under 
the name of vimamsa in the adhipati relation; under the name of panna in the 
indriya relation; and under the name of sammaditthi in the magga relation. 
Saddha or faith is the indriya relation. Sati or mindfulness is a satindriya in 
the indriya relation, and a sammasati in the magga relation. The three 
abstinences (right speech, right action, right livelihood) are magga relations. 
The remaining seventeen mental states are not particular relations.</P>
<P>Thirty-eight mental properties enter into combination with the eight moral 
classes of kama-consciousness (kama=sense desires). They are: seven universals, 
six particulars, and twenty-five sobhana. Of these, pleasurable interest enters 
into combination only with the four classes of consciousness accompanied by joy. 
Intelligence also enters into combination with the four classes connected with 
knowledge. The three abstinences enter into combination only when moral 
rules</FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua" size=4> </FONT><FONT 
face="Book Antiqua">or precepts are observed. The two illimitables arise only 
when sympathizing with the suffering, or sharing in the happiness, of living 
beings. In these eight classes of consciousness, the dual or triple roots are 
hetu relations. Among the four kinds of adhipati, i.e. desire-to-do, mind, 
effort, and investigation, each is an adhipati in turn. Volition is the relation 
of kamma. The three foods are the relations of ahara. The eight mental states, 
i.e. mind, sensation, concentration, psychic life, faith, mindfulness, effort 
and intelligence are relations of indriya. The five jhana factors, i.e. initial 
application, sustained application, pleasurable interest, sensation and 
concentration are relations of jhana. The eight path-constituents, i.e. 
investigation, initial application, the three abstinences, mindfulness, effort 
and concentration are relations of magga. Therefore, only the two relations 
(pacchajata and vipaka) are not obtained in these eight classes of 
consciousness, and the remaining twenty-two are obtained. The three abstinences 
do not obtain in the eight sobhana classes of inoperative consciousness. As in 
the moral consciousness, two relations are unobtainable and twenty-two are 
obtainable here. The three abstinences and the two illimitables also do not 
obtain in the eight beautiful classes of resultant consciousness. The relations 
unobtainable are three in number, namely, adhipati, pacchajata and asevana; and 
the remaining twenty-one are obtainable.</P>
<P>The higher classes of rupa, arupa and transcendental consciousness, do not 
obtain more than twenty-two relations. The synchrony of relations should be 
understood as existing in the four moral classes of kama-consciousness connected 
with knowledge. If this be so, then why are those classes of consciousness more 
supreme and transcendental than the kama-consciousness? Because of the greatness 
of asevana. They are fashioned by marked exercises, and so asevana is superior 
to them; for this reason, indriya, jhana, magga and other relations also become 
superior. When these relations become supreme--each higher and higher than the 
other--those classes of consciousness also become more supreme and 
transcendental than kama--consciousness. .</P></FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua"

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H3>A. Four essential material qualities:</H3></FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua">
<P>The element of solidity (pathavi)</P>
<P>The element of cohesion (apo)</P>
<P>The element of kinetic energy (tejo)</P>
<P>The element of motion (vayo); the tangible (photthabba): this material 
quality is composed of three essentials, namely, the element of extension, the 
element of kinetic energy and the element of motion.</P></FONT><FONT

<H3>B. Five sensitive material qualities:</H3></FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua">

<P>Male sex (pumbhava).</P></FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua" size=4>
<H3>E. One material quality of life (jivita).</H3>
<H3>F. One material quality of heart-base (hadaya-vatthu).</H3>
<H3>G. One material quality of nutrition (ahara).</H3>
<H3>H. One material quality of limitation (akasa-dhatu).</H3>
<H3>I. Two material qualities of communication:</H3></FONT><FONT 
face="Book Antiqua">
<P>intimation by the body (kayavinnatti)</P>
<P>intimation by speech (vacivinnatti).</P></FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua" 
size=4>
<H3>J. Three material qualities of plasticity:</H3></FONT><FONT 
face="Book Antiqua">
<P>Lightness (lahuta)</P>
<P>Pliancy (muduta)</P>
<P>Adaptability (kammannata).</P></FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua" size=4>
<H3>K. Four material qualities of salient features:</H3></FONT><FONT 
face="Book Antiqua">
<P>Integration (upacaya)</P>
<P>Continuance (santati)</P>
<P>Decay (jarata)</P>
<P>Impermanence (aniccata).</P>
<P>Of these, six kinds of material qualities--viz., the four essentials, the 
material quality of life, and the material quality of nutrition--causally relate 
themselves to the material qualities. Here also the four essentials are mutually 
related among themselves by way of five relations: sahajata, annamanna, nissaya, 
atthi, and avigata; and they are related to the coexistent material qualities 
derived from the latter by way of four relations (i.e. excluding annamanna in 
the above five). The material quality of life causally relates itself to the 
coexistent material qualities produced by kamma by way of indriya. The material 
quality of nutrition causally relates itself to both the coexistent and the 
non-coexistent material qualities, which are corporeal by way</FONT><FONT 
face="Book Antiqua" size=4> </FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua">of ahara.</P>
<P>Again, thirteen kinds of material qualities causally relate themselves to the 
mental states by some particular relations. These material qualities are: the 
five kinds of sensitive material qualities, the seven kinds of sense-fields, and 
the heart-basis. Of these, just as a mother is related to her son, so also the 
five kinds of sensitive material qualities are causally related to the five 
sense-cognitions by way of vatthu-purejata, by way of vatthu-purejatindriya, and 
by way of vatthupurejata-vippayutta. And just as a father is related to his son, 
so also the seven sense-fields are causally related to the five sense-cognitions 
and the three elements of apprehension by way of arammanapurejata. In the same 
way, just as a tree is related to the deva who inhabits it, so also the 
heart-basis causally relates itself to the two elements of apprehension and 
comprehension by way of sahajatanissaya at the time of rebirth, and by way of 
vatthupurejata and of vatthu-purejata-vippayutta during life.</P>
<P>There are twenty-three groups of material qualities. They are called groups 
because they are tied up with the material quality of production (jati-rupa) 
into groups, just as hair or hay is tied up with a string.[32] Of these, the 
eight kinds of material qualities, such as, the Four Essentials, color, odor, 
taste, and nutritive essence, make up the primary octad of all material 
qualities.</P>
<P>There are nine groups produced by kamma: the vital nonad, the basic-decad, 
the body-decad, the female-decad, the male-decad, the eye-decad, the ear-decad, 
the nose-decad, and the tongue-decad. Of these, the primary octad together with 
the material quality of vitality, is called the vital nonad. This primary nonad 
together with each of the eight material qualities, i.e. heart-basis and so 
forth, makes up analogously the other eight decads, i.e. base-decad, and so 
forth. Here the four groups: vital nonad, body-decad, and twofold sex-decad, 
locate themselves in a creature, pervading the whole body. Here vital-nonad is 
the name of the maturative fire (pacakaggi) and of the bodily fire (kayaggi). 
Pacakaggi, or maturative fire, is that which locates itself in the stomach and 
matures or digests the food that has been eaten, drunk, chewed and licked. 
Kayaggl, or the bodily fire, is that which locates itself by pervading the whole 
body, and it refines the impure bile, phlegm and blood. Through the inharmonious 
action of these two elements, creatures become unhealthy, and by their 
harmonious action they become healthy. It is this dual fire (or that 
vital-nonad) that gives life and good complexion to creatures.</P>
<P>The body-decad makes available pleasurable and painful contact. The twofold 
sex-decads make available all the feminine characteristics to females and all 
the masculine characteristics to males. The remaining five decads are termed 
partial decads. Of these, the heart-decad, locating itself in the cavity of the 
heart, makes available many various kinds of moral and immoral thoughts. The 
four decads, i.e. eye-decad and so forth, locating themselves respectively in 
the eye-ball, in the interior of the ear, in the interior of the nose, and on 
the surface of the tongue, make available sight, hearing, smell, and taste.</P>
<P>There are eight groups produced by mind: the primary octad, the sound-nonad, 
the nonad of body-communication, the sound-decad of speech-communication. Taking 
these four together with lightness, pliancy and adaptability, they make up 
another four: the undecad of plasticity, the sound-dodecad of plasticity, the 
dodecad of body-communication together with plasticity, and the sound-tre-decad 
of speech-communication together with plasticity. The last four are termed 
plastic groups, and the first four are termed primary groups.</P>
<P>Of these, when the elements of the body are not working harmoniously, only 
the four primary groups occur to a sick person, whose material qualities then 
become heavy, coarse and inadaptable, and consequently it becomes difficult for 
him to maintain the bodily postures as he would wish, to move the members of the 
body, and even to make a vocal reply. But when the elements of the body are 
working harmoniously--there being no defects of the body, such as heaviness and 
so on, in a healthy person--the four plastic groups come into existence. Among 
these four, two groups of body-communication occur by means of mind or by moving 
any part of the body. The other two groups of speech-communication occur also on 
account of mind, when wishing to speak: but when non-verbal sound is produced 
through laughing or crying, only the two ordinary sound-groups occur. At other 
times the first two groups, the primary octad and the sound nonad, occur 
according to circumstances.</P>
<P>There are four groups produced by physical change: the two primary groups 
(i.e. the primary octad and the sound nonad) and the two plastic groups, i.e. 
the undecad of plasticity and the sound dodecad of plasticity). Now this body of 
ours maintains itself right on throughout the whole life, through a long course 
of bodily postures. Hence, at every moment, there occur in this body the 
harmonious and inharmonious workings of the elements, through changes in the 
postures; through changes in its temperature, through changes of food, air, and 
heat; through changes of the disposition of the members of the body; and through 
changes of one"s own exertion and of others. Here also, when working 
harmoniously, two plastic groups occur; and when working inharmoniously, the 
other two primary groups occur. Of the four groups, two sound-groups arise when 
there occur various kinds of sound other than that produced by mind.</P>
<P>There are two groups produced by food: the primary octad and the undecad of 
plasticity. These two groups should be understood as the harmonious and 
inharmonious occurrences of material qualities produced respectively by suitable 
and unsuitable food.</P>
<P>The five material qualities, namely, the element of space and the four 
salient features of matter, lie outside the grouping. Of these, the element of 
space lies outside the grouping because it is the boundary of the groups. As to 
the material qualities of the salient features, they are left aside from 
grouping, because they are merely the marks or signs of conditioned things, 
through which we clearly know them to be really conditioned things.</P>
<P>These twenty-three groups are available in an individual. The groups 
available in external things are only two, which are no other than those 
produced by physical change. There are two locations of material qualities, the 
internal and the external. Of these two, the internal location means the 
location of a sentient being and the external location means the earth, hills, 
rivers, oceans, trees, and so forth. Therefore have we said that, in an 
individual, twenty-three groups, or all the twenty-eight kinds of material 
qualities, are available.</P>
<P>Now the rebirth-conception and its mental concomitants are causally related 
to the groups produced by kamma at the moment of conception, by way of six 
different relations: the four superior sahajatas, the vipakas, and vippayutta. 
But to the heart-basis alone, they are causally related by seven relations, that 
is, the above together with the relation of annamanna. Among the mental states 
at the moment of rebirth, the roots are causally related by way of 
the</FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua" size=4> </FONT><FONT 
face="Book Antiqua">hetu relation; the volition, by way of ahara; the controls, 
by way of indriya; the jhana constituents, by way of jhana; and the 
path-constituents, by way of Path to the kamma- produced groups. The past moral 
and immoral volitions are causally related by way of kamma alone. The first 
posterior life-continuum, the second, the third, and so on and so forth, are 
causally related to the prior material qualities produced by kamma, by way of 
pacchajata. By pacchajata are meant all the species of pacchajata. The past 
volitions are causally related by way of kamma alone. Thus, the mental states 
are causally related to the material qualities produced by kamma, by fourteen 
different relations. Here, ten relations are not obtained, i.e. arammana, 
adhipati, anantara, samanantara, upanissaya, purejata, asevana, sampayutta, 
natthi and vigata.</P>
<P>During the term of life, mental states which are capable of producing 
material qualities, are causally related to the coexistent material qualities 
produced by them, by five different relations: the four superior sahajatas, and 
vippayutta. Among these mental states--the hetus are causally related by way of 
hetu, the dominances by way of adhipati, the volition by way of kamma, the 
resultants by way of vipaka, the foods by way of ahara, the controls by way of 
indriya, the jhana factors by way of jhana, the path-constituents by way of 
magga, to the mind-produced material qualities. All the posterior mental states 
are causally related to the prior material qualities produced by mind, by way of 
pacchajata. Thus the mental states are causally related to the material groups 
produced by mind, by fourteen different relations. Here also ten relations are 
not obtainable: arammana, anantara, samanantara, annamanna, upanissaya, 
purejata, asevana, sampayutta, natthi, and vigata.</P>
<P>During a lifetime, starting from the static phase of conception, all mental 
states are causally related both to the material groups produced by food and to 
those produced by physical change solely by way of pacchajata. Here again, by 
pacchajata are meant all the four species of pacchajata. The remaining twenty 
relations are not obtainable.</P>
<P>Among the twenty-three groups of material qualities, the four essentials are 
mutually related among themselves by way of five different relations, namely, 
four superior sahajatas and one annamanna; but to the coexistent derivative 
material qualities by way of the four superior sahajatas only. The material 
quality of nutritive essence is causally related by way of ahara, both to the 
coexistent and the non-coexistent material qualities which are corporeal. The 
material quality of physical life in the nine groups produced by kamma is 
causally related only to the coexistent material qualities by way of indriya. 
Thus the corporeal material qualities are causally related to the corporeals by 
seven different relations. As for the</FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua" size=4> 
</FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua">external material qualities, they are mutually 
related to two external groups produced by physical change, by way of five 
different relations.</P></FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua" size=4>

<P>&nbsp;</P></FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua">
<P>The meaning of the term 'Patthana' also will now be explained. "Padhanam 
thanam ti Patthanam": Patthana is the pre-eminent or principal cause. In this 
definition 'Padhana' means 'pre-eminent' and the word 'thana' means 'condition' 
or 'cause'. Hence the whole expression means the "pre-eminent cause", "the 
actual cause" or "the ineluctable cause". This is said having reference to its 
ineluctable effect or result.[33] There are two kinds of effect, namely the 
direct and the indirect. By "the direct" is meant the primary or actual effect, 
and by "the indirect" is meant the consequent or incidental effect. Of these two 
kinds, only the direct effect is here referred to as ineluctable, and for this 
reason: that it never fails to arise when its proper cause is established or 
brought into play. And the indirect effect is to be understood as "eluctable", 
since it may or may not arise</FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua" size=4> 
</FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua">even though its cause is fully established. 
Thus the ineluctable cause is so named with reference to the ineluctable effect. 
Hence the ineluctable or principal cause alone is meant to be expounded in this 
"Great Treatise". For this reason the name 'Patthana' is assigned to 
the</FONT><FONT face="Book Antiqua" size=4> </FONT><FONT 
face="Book Antiqua">entire collection of the twenty-four relations, and also to 
the "Great Treatise".</P>
<P>And now, to make the matter more clear and simple.</P>
<P>Say that greed springs into being within a man who desires to get money and 
grain. Under the influence of greed, he goes to a forest where he clears a piece 
of land and establishes fields, yards and gardens, and starts to work very hard. 
Eventually he obtains plenty of money and grain by reason of his strenuous 
labors. So he takes his gains, looks after his family, and performs many 
virtuous deeds, from which also he will reap rewards in his future existences, 
In this illustration, all the mental and material states coexisting with greed, 
are called direct effects. Apart from these, all the outcomes, results and 
rewards, which are to be enjoyed later on in his future existences, are called 
indirect effects. Of these two kinds of effects, only the former is dealt with 
in the Patthana. However, the latter kind finds its place in the Suttanta 
discourses. If this exists, then that happens; or, because of the occurrence of 
this, that also takes place. Such an exposition is called "expounding by way of 
Suttanta". In fact, the three states (greed, hate, and ignorance) are called the 
hetus or conditions, because they are the roots whence spring the defilements of 
the whole animate world, of the whole inanimate world and of the world of space. 
The three other opposite states (disinterestedness, amity, and knowledge) are 
also called hetus or conditions, since they are the roots whence springs 
purification. In the same manner the remainder of the Patthana relations are to 
be understood in their various senses. Thus must we understand that all things 
that happen, occur, take place, or produce changes, are solely the direct and 
indirect effects, results, outcomes, or products of these twenty-four Patthana 
relations or causes.</P>

Relations, in these three sections: The Paccayatthadipani (The Analytical

understood in the sense of "is related to", "are related to", etc., 
respectively.</P>

190.</P>

<P>[3] In this relation, "Paccaya" is generally known as "arammana" = "hanger" 
(as a pot-hook) = "object"; and paccayuppanna" is known as "arammanika" 
="hanger-on" = " subject." (Translator.)</P>
<P>[4] The six doors of the senses--mind, in Buddhist Philosophy, making the 
sixth "sense".</P>
<P>[5] See CompendiLim of Philosophy, page 83.</P>
<P>[6] Note by Translator. Dhammato is equal to vatthuto or sarupato or 
pabhedato. Cittuppada has three aspects of meaning. Firstly, it means 
"consciousness," as in: "Tesam cittaviyuttanam yathiiyogam ito param, 
Cittuppadesu paccekam sampayogo pavuccati."</P>
<P>(See Part II, Sangaha).</P>
<P>Secondly, it means "genesis of thought", as in: "Vithicittani satt'eva: 
Cittuppada catuddasa: Catupannasa vitthhara Pancadvare Yatharaham"</P>
<P>(See Part IV, Sangaha.)</P>
<P>Thirdly, it means "mind and its concomitants," as in: "Cittuppadanam" 
icc'evam Katva sangaham" uttaram,Bhumipuggalabhedena Pubbaparaniyamitam."</P>
<P>(See Part IV, Sangaha.)</P>
<P>In each of these instances, the construction of the compound "cittuppada" 
should also be noted. In the first instance, it is constructed as follows: 
Uppajjatiti uppado. Cittam"eva uppado cittuppado; in the second instance, 
Cittassa uppado cittuppado: in the third instance, Uppajjati etena'ti uppado 
dhammasamuho. Cittanca uppado ca cittuppado.</P>
<P>[7] Note by Translator Lokuttaradhammas are here meant, i e., the four pairs 
made up of the four stages of the Path with the Fruit of the same and 
Nibbána.</P>
<P>[8] Sights, sounds, odors, savors, contacts, ideas.</P>
<P>[9] Truth here means the sincerity of the promise he had given. 
Translator.</P>
<P>[10] Mind, here refers to one of the apperceptions which are usually 
fifty-five in all, but in this connection we must exclude the two classes of 
dull consciousness as well as aesthetic pleasure. The other three dominants are 
their own concomitants. Translator.</P>
<P>[11] In no mass of earth, water, fire, or air, do these "elements" exist in a 
state of absolute purity. The other "elements" are always present, but in a very 
subordinate proportion.</P>
<P>[12] That is one who attains Nibbána unaided.</P>
<P>[13] Here, Science, Arts, and Handicrafts are meant.</P>
<P>[14] Ledi Sayadaw here seems to explain the life term of a womb-born 
being.</P>
<P>[15] Has been rendered as "sustained cessation". Here the cessation is that 
not only of consciousness but also of mental concomitants and mental qualities, 
born of mind. (Translator.)</P>
<P>[16] Here (hadayam) is the seat of (citta) thought.</P>
<P>[17] That is to say, Nibbána and concepts (or more properly, concept-terms) 
do not enter time, and therefore are not subject to time's nature, change. They 
do not "arise"; therefore they do not "cease". They are "everlasting and 
eternal" in the sense of being extra-temporal, not in the vulgar sense of being 
endlessly continuous in time.</P>
<P>[18] Here abyakata is rendered as "unspecified" or "unmoral". It is explained 
in the commentary as Kusala-akusalabhavena akathita, annabhavena kathita; i.e., 
not to be called as moral or immoral, but to be called as "apart-from-both", 
i.e., unmoral or unspecified. The abyakatadhammas are--All classes of resultant 
and inoperative consciousness and all material qualities, as well as well as 
Nibbána. Translator.</P>
<P>[19] That is "sufficing condition" as set forth in the manner of the Suttas 
or general discourses of the Buddha, as distinguished from the manner in which 
it is dealt with in the Abhidhamma section of the Scriptures.</P>
<P>[20] Niyamadipani was written by the late Ven. Ledi Sayadaw and translated 
into English by Ven. U Nyana and Dr. Barua.</P>
<P>[21] Beings whose coming into existence takes place in any other mode than 
the ordinary one of birth from parents; what occidentals might call 
"supernatural beings" though not all of them are to be understood as superior to 
man in any vital respect. Many are inferior to man, in power and faculty, as 
well as in the opportunities open to them of winning Nibbána. Translator.</P>
<P>[22] Here, the origins of material qualities are meant. The word "origin" is 
used in the sense of Darwin as in the "Origin of the Species."</P>
<P>[23] Here, utu (lit., season) has been rendered as "temperature". It may also 
be rendered by popular acceptance, as "physical change," "caloric energy," "heat 
and cold," etc.</P>
<P>[24] Ledi Sayadaw has not explained the cetanavattha. But it is easy enough 
to understand, since it is the commission of the initial volition or kamma.</P>
<P>[25] The Four Causes are (1) kamma, (2) citta (consciousness), (3) utu 
(temperature) and (4) ahara (nutriment).</P>
<P>[26] Of these, the last three are confined to lokuttara alone. And of these 
three, the first is the knowledge pertaining to the First Path, the second that 
pertaining to the last three Paths and the first three Fruitions, and the third 
pertaining to the last Fruition only.</P>
<P>[27] See Compendium, Part VII.</P>
<P>[28] Standing out of, or going beyond, its normal mode.</P>
<P>[29] "Certainly O Kaccana, (the soul) exists is the one extreme, and (the 
soul) does not exist, is the second extreme." This is a passage where the 
problem of soul, self or ego is discussed as to its existence or non-existence 
as a real personal entity.</P>
<P>[30] Here, the word appaccaya is not a kammadharaya compound but of the 
bahubbihi class--thus: natthi paccaya etesam ti appacaya. Asankhata is a 
kammadharaya compound--thus: samkariyante ti sankhata; na sankhata ti 
asankhata.</P>
<P>[31] There are four postures for all beings: sitting, standing, walking and 
lying down.</P>
<P>[32] Ledi Sayadaw here makes the number of groups twenty-three instead of 
twenty-one, as in the Compendium. (Cf. Compendium, page 164.)</P>
<P>He also makes the groups of material qualities produced by thought number 
eight instead of six, as in the Compendium; thus they are here increased by two. 
(Cf. Paramatthadipani, page 273.) Translator.</P>
<P>[33] Elsewhere I have rendered the word "paccayuppana" as "related 
things."</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
