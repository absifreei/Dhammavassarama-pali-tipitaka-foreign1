<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Editor's
Foreword<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In <i>the
Manuals of Buddhism</i> (first published in 1965) already referred to
elsewhere, there is reference to a translation, by the Editors of <i>the Light
of the Dhamma </i>(of the first 2 Chapters, up to and including the Analysis of
the Element of Heat <i>(Tejo))</i> of <i>Alin-Kyan.</i> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That
this work of Ledi Sayadaw's should be readily available in a complete
translation has always been thought essential and long overdue. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>With
very good fortune a well-known translator - U Tin U (Myaung) - was found who
very kindly and with great ability produced an entirely new and most readable
translation, as long ago as May 1983. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Unfortunately,
due to a whole series of difficulties and delays it is only now that
publication has become possible. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>With
prior approval the translation was submitted to the well-known Burmese
scholar-monk the Venerable Sayadaw U Nyanika, Aggamahapandita, who very kindly
undertook to critically read through the whole of U Tin U's translation and
suggested several valuable improvements on the rendering of some technical <i>Abhidhamma</i>
terms, as well as of a few Burmese words, most of which have now been
incorporated in this first complete translation into English. Regretfully,
however, minor inconsistencies still remain. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>About
the author I do not think it would be out-of-place to repeat here what has
already been said in the present Editor's &quot;Foreword&quot; to the English
translation of the <i>Magganga Dipani - The Manual of the Constituents of the
Noble Path </i>- :<br>
The Venerable Ledi Arannaviharavasi Maha Thera of Monywa better known as the
Venerable Ledi Sayadaw, Aggamahapandita, D. Litt. is described, in the short
Biography reproduced at the end of this work as 'perhaps the outstanding
Buddhist figure of this age'. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Of
this there can be little doubt and provides the very reason why every attempt
should be made to make known to Western readers and in particular English
speaking readers as many as possible of the numerous works originally written
by him either in Pali or Burmese, which are clear and precise expositions of
Buddhism, suited to people of wide and differing abilities and understanding
and are invaluable aids for the study and practice of Dhamma in all its
aspects. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Of
works already translated into English every credit must be given to the Pali
Text Society, England, for publishing as early as 1913-14, in their Journal for
those years, a translation of selected passages of<i> Yamaka Puccha Vissajjana
-'Some Points in Buddhist Doctrine'</i> and again in their Journal for the years
1915-16 a translation, by U Shwe Zan Aung, B.A., of the <i>Patthanuddesa Dipani</i>
or <i>'Philosophy of Relations</i>'. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
it is to Burma that so much is owed for continuing with the translation into
English and publication of the works of this Sayadaw, through the medium of the
periodical 'The Light of the Dhamma', which was printed by the Union Buddha
Sasana Council Press. The Inaugural Number of this periodical first appeared in
1952 but, unfortunately, publication ceased about 11 years later in 1963, though
the publication was revived about 1979. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>During
these first 11 years some 7 major works or <i>Dipanis,</i> translated by
various hands, had been published, in serial form. in <i>'The Light of the
Dhamma',</i> and all these works continue to be available, though separately,
combined together in I volume -<i>'The Manuals of Buddhism'</i> - and published
by the Department of Religious Affairs, Rangoon. Regrettably this Manual, as
well as other Buddhist publications, are often extremely difficult to obtain
outside Burma and sometimes are to be found only in Public, University, or
Buddhist libraries. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Although
in the short Biography reproduced hereafter a figure of more than 70 works is
shown to have been written by the Venerable Sayadaw, when including smaller
articles not already recorded and many relevant letters, etc., the final figure
may well be found to be in excess of 100 as further research continues and an
attempt made to compile a comprehensive list. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
addition 2 separate Biographies which have been written about Ledi Sayadaw
still await a competent translator into English and a donor to sponsor
publication. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
reputation of Ledi Sayadaw still lives on in Burma and in the Buddhist world.
He was a Bhikkhu of great learning, and a prolific writer with a unique style
of exposition, and although there are some traditionalists who do not support
or agree with some of his interpretations. there are those who find them of
great interest. He was also an austere Bhikkhu, yet a very human one, who would
often write a whole treatise or a long letter in reply to a question asked by
one of his supporters or enquirers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Apart
from accepting many bhikkhu-students from various parts of Burma in order to
impart Buddhist education to them Ledi Sayadaw also toured many parts of Burma
for the purpose of propagating the Buddha Dhamma; delivering various discourses
on the Dhamma; establishing <i>Abhidhamma</i> classes and Meditation centres.
He also composed <i>Abhidhamma </i>rhymes or <i>Abhidhamma Sankhitta</i> and
taught them to his <i>Abhidhamma</i> classes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the year 1910, while residing at Masoyain Monastery, Mandalay, the Venerable
Ledi Sayadaw together with the Abhi Dhaja Maha Rattha Guru Masoyain Sayadaw of
Mandalay (President of the Sixth Great Buddhist Council), the Venerable Saydaw
U Nyana (who also translated into English Ledi Sayadaw's <i>Patthanuddesa
Dipani</i> (or <i>Paccayuddesadipani</i>) - 'The Concise Exposition of the
Patthana Relations', but published under the title <i>'The Buddhist Philosophy
of Relations'</i>) and U Shwe Zan Aung B.A., founded the Burma Buddhist Foreign
Mission and this project was carried on by the Masoyain Sayadaw of Mandalay
until the death of his English-educated colleague in this undertaking the
Sayadaw U Nyana, who died some 13 years after the death of the Venerable Ledi
Sayadaw, who died in 1923. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
are still monasteries in Burma such as the Kyaikkasan Ledi Meditation Centre in
Rangoon, as well as the one established by Ledi Sayadaw himself near Monywa
under the name of Leditawya Monastery where his teachings and expositions are preserved
and continue to be studied. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It is
well known that at Mandalay in Burma in 1856 King Mindon (1852-1877) conceived
the meritorious idea of having the Pali <i>Tipitaka</i> carved on (729) marble
slabs, in order that the Teaching might be preserved, the work taking from 1860
to 1868. In 1871 King Mindon convened the Fifth Great Buddhist Council. It is
not, however, so well known, outside Burma that a similar mark of respect for
the works of the Venerable Ledi Sayadaw was made, by his supporters, at Monywa
in Upper Burma after his death. This recognition and treatment of a Buddhist
monk's works must be unique and gives some indication of the immense importance
attached to his writings. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
already mentioned importance attached to Ledi Sayadaw's works and the
difficulty of obtaining them in the Western World demands that every effort be
made to try and collect as many as possible of the Sayadaw's works, either in
Pali, Burmese or in translation, and make them accessible to the West by adding
them, by way of presentation. to the large number of his works already held by
the British Library in London, where they would continue to be available to
Bhikkhus, scholars, students and the like. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
undertaking the reprinting of the <i>Alin-Kyan,</i> however, a small effort is being
made to make this fundamental Exposition of the Buddha's Teaching available to
interested students and readers in both the East and the West with the earnest
wish that others will be encouraged thereby to help make the works of the
Venerable Ledi Sayadaw known to a wider audience. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Venerable Ledi Sayadaw wrote the <i>Alin-Kyan</i> in Burmese but the retention
or use of Pali words in translations has always been considered essential for,
in cases where any doubt may arise as to the suitability of the word or words
used by the translator, the quoting of the Pali ensures that a clear and
definite meaning, which may vary in accordance with the context in which they
are used, is most often to be found in the original Pali and its Commentaries. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
addition to the invaluable aid it provides for students and other interested
readers, as a means of reference for study purposes, the inclusion of Pali may
also be said to add to the translation the savour of the language of the Buddha
himself, as found in the <i>Pali Canon,</i> together with the voice of
elucidation of its Commentators. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

materiality and mentality caused by Consciousness, Temperature or Nutriment it
is wrong. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Craving, Clinging and the Process of Becoming. If we consider it in the light
of the Doctrine of Relations <i>(Patthana),</i> this view recognizes only the
relationship of past kamma to its effects <i>(nanakkhanika kamma paccaya)</i>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>one
can attain this Second Light. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the ultimate sense, (as taught in the <i>Abhidhamma,</i> the 'Higher Doctrine'),
there is no personal entity in what is generally called a person or a being,
nor a soul or a self or a life anywhere. What really exists are the six
Elements such as the Element of Extension <i>(pathavi).</i> In worldly usage we
speak of person or being or a life but these are mere conceptual terms. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>An
example</span></i><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Let
us take one example. We have around us a variety of structures built of timber
or bamboo, such as a house, a monastery, a temple, a rest-house or a pandal.
When we speak of a certain structure as a 'house' we are not referring to the
timber or the bamboo of which it is built; rather we are referring to a certain
type of structure generally recognized as a house which is only a secondary
name of the timber or bamboo in it. When these materials - timber or bamboo -
were in the form of standing trees, they were not called a house. Only when
they have assumed the shape of a house do they acquire the secondary name of
'house'. Now this name is a mere coinage, something that has suddenly appeared,
as if a bolt from the blue. It is actually foreign to the true material that it
is built of. In the ultimate sense, therefore, we see that there is no such
thing as 'house', but only timber or bamboo. The name 'house' therefore only
refers to a certain type of structure, after a certain shape or appearance that
it has taken: it does not exist in the last analysis. For the same materials -
timber or bamboo as the case may be - that once went into the construction of
the house may, after the house has been pulled down, be re-built as a monastery
in a monastic compound. They then assume the form of a monastery, and are
called a monastery accordingly. The shape and form of a house is no more there,
so we do not call it a house any more. Again, let us say, the self-same
materials, after the monastery having been pulled down, are rebuilt as a temple
or a turreted tower <i>(pyathat)</i> in front of a pagoda. Then they take the
new shape known as a temple or a turreted tower, and are therefore called a
'temple' or a 'tower', and not a 'monastery'. Further, let us say, these
materials are reused in the construction of a rest-house, the name 'temple'
disappears, and the new name of 'rest-house' is used in respect of the same
materials. Further again, if that rest-house be converted into a pandal, the
name 'rest-house' disappears, and the new name of 'pandal' comes into use. When
forms are destroyed, names disappear. Only when forms appear, names also come
into common usage. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
materials - timber or bamboo - that have gone into the construction of the
various structures, are all the time just timber or bamboo. They were timber or
bamboo as standing trees; when they have taken on the various shapes of
'house', 'monastery', 'temple', 'rest-house' or 'Pandal', they are still timber
or bamboo. When the pandal is pulled down and its component parts piled on the
ground, the materials are still piles of timber or bamboo. By origin there is
no such thing as 'house', 'monastery'. 'temple', 'rest-house' or 'pandal': only
when the basic materials are assembled into such shapes do those terms become
valid. The basic materials - timber or bamboo - are there throughout as timber
or bamboo, for they are of their own origin. That is why it is said that in the
ultimate sense, according to the <i>Adhidhamma.</i> there is no such thing as
'house'. monastery', 'temple', 'rest-house' or pandal', only timber or bamboo
exist in truth and reality. Yet when we say the house exists, it is not telling
a falsehood, for in the conventional sense the statement is true, and it does
not mislead anyone. In the ultimate sense of the <i>Abhidhamma,</i> however, it
is wrong to say the house exists because what we call a house is merely a
certain structural form built by the architect, conventionally accepted as a
house. If someone asks, &quot;What actually is the thing called 'house'?&quot;
and someone points to the building and says, &quot;This is a house&quot;, here
in conventional usage this is correct. But in the <i>Abhidhamma</i> sense it is
incorrect. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Why?
Because, what actually does the pointing finger mean, the house or the
timber/bamboo? Since what is called a house is in fact a mere structural form,
what is actually meant is only the timber/bamboo, the real things, the things
that originally exist. To call these materials a house is a mere misconception,
a case of mistaken identity. If the name 'house' were the true name that is
intrinsically applicable to timber or bamboo, the name must have been used when
timber or bamboo were standing as trees. And also, whatever form of structure
(monastery, temple, etc.) these materials may have assumed, the name 'house'
should be the valid term of reference for them. But this is not the case. A
house is a house only when certain materials are put into a certain
conventional form called a house. Similarly, the names 'monastery', 'temple'.
etc., also are valid only when the basic materials have the shapes of what are
conventionally recognized as monastery or temple, etc. This is how conventional
truth differs from the ultimate truth of the <i>Abhidhdmma.</i> This difference
should be well understood. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Of
these two, conventional truth is used in the mundane sphere and is valid in its
own sphere only. The ultimate truth of the <i>Abhidhamma,</i> on the other
hand, is useful to get one beyond the mundane sphere to the supramundane sphere
of <i>Nibbana.</i> Using timber or bamboo, we make all sorts of objects - say,
couch, throne, bench, boat or cart which go by these various names
conventionally. In the <i>Abhidhamma</i> sense. however. no such thing as
couch, throne, bench, boat or cart really exists: only the materials of which
they are made really exists. Using earth we make pots, basins, cups and vessels
which are called by these respective names conventionally; but according to the
<i>Abhidhamma</i> there are no such things as pot, basin, cup or vessel - all
are only earth. Iron is made into all sorts of ironmongery, copper into all
sorts of copperware; gold into all sorts of gold-ware; silver into all sorts of
silver-ware; cotton into all sorts of fabrics and dresses. and all of them
acquire the names of the fabricated products. According to the <i>Abhidhamma, </i>none
of those objects exists, but only the basic materials of which they are made
exist. We should distinguish what is the basic truth of the original material
from the fabricated object that has taken on a certain form. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
respect of person, being, self (soul) or a life too, these terms are valid
conventionally only. In the <i>Abhidhamma</i> there exists no person, being,
self (soul) nor a life; only the six basic Elements such as <i>pathavi</i>
exist. No such thing as man or deva, Sakka or Brahma, cow, buffalo or elephant
exists in truth; in reality only the six basic Elements exist in all the world.
Woman, man, this or that person, I, you, etc. are conventional terms for that
which do not really exist; what really exist are the six basic Elements only.
So there is no head, leg, hand, eye, ear, nose. etc., because all are the six
basic Elements in the last analysis. All the organs of the body such as hair,
body-hair, nails, teeth. skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone-marrow, kidneys,
heart, liver, pleura, spleen, lungs, large intestines, small intestines,
stomach, bowels (faeces), etc., do not exist: but only the Elements such as <i>pathavi</i>
etc., really exist. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All
along the long, vast extent of <i>Samsara's</i> journey, we have become
ingrained in misconcepts about things all about us and around us, believing
mere forms as facts of life. The fact lies in the truth that all things, big or
small, in the ultimate analysis, are a mere heap of elements, a mass of
elements, a collection of elements, a lump of elements, and nothing more. Such
definitive insight is the Light of Knowledge called 'being firmly settled in
the Dhamma'. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

hardness. By <i>pathavi</i> is not meant any substance - not even a hundred

is why) this Element exists in very clear spring water or river water; in all
forms of light including sunlight and moonlight or even the lustre of gems; in
sound - all vibrant sounds including the sounds of gongs or pagoda bells; in
moving air - from the softest breeze to gales; in smells, good or bad, that
spread near and far. The rationale for this peculiar property lies in the state

Commentaries explain that it is the function <i>(sampaticchana rasa)</i> of
Earth Element <i>(pathavi)</i> to receive the three other (co-nascent) elements
of Water, Wind and Fire. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
nature of Water, Wind and Fire Elements are such that they cannot exist without
Earth Element as their basis. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>From
the foregoing statements it should be understood that in all forms of water,
colour, sound, wind and smell, there invariably exists this Earth Element. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
is on the authority of the scriptures. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Proof
by empirical data can also be made. In any mass of water or of wind, it is
fairly evident that the lower layers are supporting the successively upper
ones. Now this function of supporting is not the property of apo whose
characteristic is cohesion. It is not the property of <i>tejo</i> either, for <i>tejo</i>
is characterised by its thermal quality only. Support is the joint function of <i>pathavi</i>
and <i>vayo.</i> Support implies hardness or the capacity to bear, and it also
implies lifting or the capacity to resist. The former is the characteristic of
Earth Element, the latter that of Wind Element. Wind Element acquires its
property of resistance on the strength of hardness, the characteristic of Earth
Element. It cannot function alone. One should try to understand the distinction
between hardness and resistance that co-exist in the function of supporting. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thus
we can discern the pressure of the element of hardness in water or in wind, and
from that we can safely conclude that the element of extension or hardness, the
ultimate Earth Element, exists in water and wind. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the case of light and smell, however, although the element of hardness or
extension is definitely there, this element is too subtle to notice. No
empirical data can be drawn from them. We have simply to rely on the authority
of the Texts. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The fact
of the presence of pathavi in the clearest water, light, wind, sound and smell,
is stated here to impress the truth that it is the mere property of hardness
that we mean by the ultimate Earth Element, to drive home the point that the
property of hardness does not mean any particle that has any form or solidity,
any minutest substance of even a hundred thousandth part of an atom. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>(The
mere property of hardness must not be confused with the manifestation of
hardness in things.) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>By
'hardness' we should understand the term as a relative concept. What is hard or
soft is spoken of by comparison: thus we have varying degrees of hardness at
the bottom of which we call it softness. With the cutting diamond or <i>Vajira</i>
at one extreme and the corporeality of a moonbeam at the other, we should
discern the same property of hardness in varying degrees in all materiality.
That is the character of Earth Element. This character of hardness can only be
discerned as an ultimate truth. For if conventional perception stands in the
way, no 'hardness' can ever be found in subtle materiality such as moonlight,
etc. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
hundreds of thousands of crores of Earth Element - by themselves the mere
property of hardness - happen to be held together by the Element of Cohesion or
Water Element, <i>Apo,</i> a form appears, which is given the name 'atom'. When
thousands of crores of such atoms come together certain forms (of life) come
into being, beginning with tiny insects. As the materiality increases, all
kinds of beings with varying sizes, up to <i>Asurinda,</i> Lord of the <i>Asuras</i>
(fallen spirits), whose height is forty-eight hundred <i>yojanas,</i> take
their forms. As regards external things this phenomenon of materiality takes
the shape and extent of Mount Meru which is 168,000 <i>yojanas</i> high, and
the Great Earth of the universe itself which has a thickness of 240,000 <i>yojanas.</i>
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It is
the Earth Element with its property of hardness that serves as the basis of all
forms of materiality, animate or inanimate, from atoms and insects to the whole
universe. And no other element has the property of assuming form or shape. The
three other elements of Water, Wind and Fire depend on Earth for their
existence. Thus one should realize the importance of Earth as the basic Element
in all materiality. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
you want to contemplate Earth as an ultimate reality in Mount Meru, or in this
Great Earth, you concentrate only on the property of hardness which lacks
substance. As you concentrate only on its function (giving support to all forms
of materiality) it will be seen as a reflection in a mirror on a clear surface
of water, without the obstruction of the tiniest substance, not even an atom. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
there remains the faintest idea of substance or form or solid mass, even as
much as an atom, your view is not on the ultimate truth of Earth. It is not
free from the concept of form conventionally accepted throughout. This
conventional truth stands in the way of understanding the true characteristics
- arisings and vanishings - of materiality. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>On
this subject of contemplating the Elements it may be mentioned that the
Venerable <i>Punna</i> taught the Venerable <i>Ananda</i> using the example of
the image in the mirror, and the Venerable <i>Ananda</i> won enlightenment of
the First Stage <i>(sotapanna).</i> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
one is to understand the property of hardness only, unencumbered by any
conventional concept of substance or form, that truly exists in Mount <i>Meru</i>
or the Great Earth, one should find it much easier to comprehend this ultimate
truth in lesser objects, animate or inanimate. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Images
reflected in the mirror - be they as big as Mount <i>Meru</i> - are liable to
vanish, when opportune, over a hundred times as fast as the blink of an eye or
a flash of lightning, because there is actually no trace of any substance in
them. Exactly so, the Earth Element in all materiality - be it as big as Mount <i>Meru</i>-
is liable to vanish, when opportune, in an equally fast manner, because there
is in the ultimate truth no substance, not even as much as an atom, in it. This
fact will dawn on the meditator. When he contemplates the Earth Element in his
own body with a view to gaining insight into physical phenomena, he should
concentrate on a specific part at a time. So when he is contemplating Earth
Element in the head he should exercise his thought throughout the head both
inside and out. While doing so the concept of colour might come in which is not
the ultimate property of Earth Element. So also the concept of form or shape
might stand in the way. All these obstructionist concepts must be discarded
with great mental alertness. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As he
proceeds to the lower parts of his body, down to the soles, he should specify
his field only to the extent of his practical capability in concentration.
Having thus covered the whole body piecemeal, he will now be in a position to
contemplate on a part, say, the head, and yet be able to comprehend the whole
body. Once such comprehension has arisen within oneself, one comprehends the
same phenomenon in all other things, animate or inanimate, in all the universe
- indeed, all other universes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And

This property alone is Water Element in the ultimate sense. When the property
of cohesion is strong it tends to ooze and become fluid - hence <i>apo</i> is
expressed as Water Element. This (basic) property of cohesion in the ultimate
sense bears no substance whatever, not even a hundred-thousandth part of an
atom: it is just a property or a function. Its function is to bind together the
three other co-existing elements of Earth, Fire and Wind so that the four exist
interdependently. Once the Water Element disappears the three other elements
become disintegrated and vanish at once. This is the crucial function of the
Water Element in any given group or unit of materiality. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All
material shapes and forms ranging from the atom to <i>Asurinda, </i>Lord of the

Element. Apart from this Water Element there is no other element that holds
materiality together. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
cohesion were to fail in Mount <i>Meru,</i> the whole 168,000 <i>yojanas</i> of

of Mount <i>Cakkavala</i> which is 164,000 <i>Yojanas</i> high, or of the Great
Earth, in which latter case we could imagine an eerie void in place of the
Great Earth. This is because when the function of cohesion is absent, even the
rock formations that make Mount <i>Meru</i> or Mount <i>Cakkavala</i> or the
Great Earth cannot stand together since the primary elements that constitute
them lack the necessary binding force. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All the

without outside help or support. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
one means to understand Water Element in Mount <i>Meru,</i> or Mount <i>Cakkavala,</i>
or the Great Earth, one should concentrate only on the property of cohesion,
without being distracted by the hardness therein (which is the property of
Earth Element). Concepts of colour and form are likely to obscure the
meditator's comprehension. In such cases Knowledge lacks definition with the
result that as one proceeds to contemplate the arisings and vanishings of
phenomena the mind gets murky. For unless the ultimate truth of a given
phenomenon (here Water Element) is comprehended well, the reality of
impermanence <i>(anicca),</i> ill <i>(dukkha)</i> and not-self <i>(anatta)</i>
will not be understood. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
has been explained in connection with Earth Element, here too when one clearly
comprehends cohesion as the ultimate truth about Water Element, one will
realize that no substance, solidity, mass or form truly exists even in Mount <i>Meru</i>
or in the Great Earth; and that apart from the cohesion that characterises all
materiality, one's concepts about shape or form or colour are just
unsubstantial and as illusive as reflected images of shapes and colour - such
as those of clouds, the sun, the moon, trees etc., - in the mirror or on the
clear surface of water. When such clear comprehension of cohesion is gained in
respect of Mount Meru or the Great Earth there can be no difficulty in
realizing this fact in living things as well - may be man or deva or Brahma. In
fact one must necessarily comprehend it in respect of living things. We begin
our reference to Mount <i>Meru</i> and the Great Earth to impress the fact of
falsity (of concept of form, shape and colour) even in the greatest masses of
material phenomena so that it will be more readily seen in respect of lesser

provides the necessary function of maturing and invigorating the three other
elements in a given physical phenomenon. (To take an example:) Eggs in a nest
need the mother-hen's body-heat by constant brooding so that they hatch
successfully. Without the mother's warmth going into them, the inborn heat
acquired while in the mother's womb could not sustain them and they would

Element) occur. Without the pressure of the Fire Element, therefore, the three
coexisting elements cannot function. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

cold (Fire) element is responsible for the existence of all forms of water,

exists not the slightest substance, even so much as an atom, is quite evident.
This fact having been clearly comprehended, the meditator understands that what
he has all along considered as big or grand forms, shapes and colours such as

fact is the motive force of Fire Element. This motive force carries the heat

and (4) motion or motive force - are inherently different from one another.
They exist together on hardness as a common base. They arise together, stand
(momentarily) together, and vanish together. When hardness fails, the three
other coexisting elements lose their base and vanish. When cohesion fails and
the binding force disappears, then the three other elements disintegrate. When
heat or cold fails, or the vital warmth goes out and the function of sustaining
life stops then the remaining three elements lose their vital force and die
out. When the distending function of Wind Element fails, the remaining three
lose support and collapse together. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Element can quiver with its inherent heat or cold only when assisted by Wind

time. Likewise, the hardness of Earth Element depends for its stability and
support on Wind Element, when this support fails, hardness disappears. Cohesion
also cannot do without the supporting function of Wind Element. This is how the
Four Great Elements with their own properties are interdependent, how failure
of one spells destruction of all. The exact functioning of the Four Great
Elements in things animate and inanimate, however, is too complex and subtle to
understand, in fact it is simply incomprehensible <i>(acinteyya).</i> Their
inherent powers also are similarly incomprehensible. Mastery over their nature
through insight (in pursuing) the Buddha's Teaching (of the Eightfold Noble
Path) leads to wisdom <i>(pativedha-nana)</i> which penetrates <i>Nibbana,</i>
also called supramundane wisdom <i>(lokuttara-vijja-nana).</i> In the mundane

to (kamma), or mind <i>(citta),</i> or temperature <i>(utu),</i> or nutriment<i>
(ahdra).</i> On these four accounts the Four Elements arise together as groups
or units of matter. Each group consists of the four elements. The element that
separates these groups is called space <i>(akasa),</i> 'that by which an object
is delimited' <i>(parrichedarupam).</i> Although the Four Great Elements come
up together and perish together, only the elements constituting the same unit
do so. The neighbouring units being separated by <i>akasa</i> are not affected.
To the ordinary eye, mass or form is seen as preconceived shapes of living
things or external physical objects. The fact of space in between
(ultra-microscopic) material units, that take the form of such living things or
objects, is not perceived. In all physical phenomena beginning with Mount <i>Meru,</i>
Mount <i>Cakkavala</i> and the Great Earth, being constituted by the Four Great
Elements, there are the element of space interstices between every unit of
matter. Thus in between all masses of materiality there are voids or space,
comparable in principle to the open sky above the Earth. It is very important
to gain a clear comprehension of this Element of Space because it is essential
for the understanding of material units, which again is essential for the
understanding of the (three) characteristics of all phenomena. To gain insight
into the three characteristics of all phenomena, you need to contemplate space
in all physical objects, animate or inanimate, and perceive its presence. The
Element of Space (unlike the Four Great Elements) does not actually arise from
some origin. (It has no objective reality.) It is only a delimiting element
that makes its appearance whenever material units come into being due to the
four causes stated above. Since it does not arise and vanish, one does not need
to contemplate it for gaining insight into its impermanence, ill or not-self.
Knowledge of the three characteristics of phenomena does not come from
contemplating <i>akasa</i> as an object in itself. Rather it needs to be
properly perceived as a necessary condition for the understanding of the three
characteristics of the Four Great Elements of Earth, Water, Wind and Fire. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

speaking, when the eye sees (i.e., comes into contact with) a visual object

phenomenon (without any one who sees) and needs to be understood clearly

thoughts is a distinct phenomenon and needs to be understood clearly through

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>How
this insight comes about will be explained now. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
physical body may be likened to a bad open sore, the six kinds of consciousness
are like maggots that infest the sore at various spots. Since consciousness is
a mental phenomenon you have to imagine it arising depending on the six
sense-bases such as eye, ear, etc. (Another way:) Imagine the six sense-bases
such as eye, ear, etc., as very clear patches of water, and the six kinds of
consciousness as reflections appearing on the individual patches of water. The
above methods are to help visualize that sense data or sense- objects are
distinct from, and external to the sense-bases. Although consciousness is
imagined as some conceptual thing at first, after long-standing contemplation
it will dawn on the mind that it is purely a mental state. Even if the mental
states are not clearly recognized, and they appear as reflections on patches of
clear water, or dew drops (falling on a piece of glass), it does not matter.
The main purpose is to comprehend the phenomena in what is commonly said as
'seeing', 'hearing', 'smelling', 'tasting', 'touching' and 'thinking'. If the
imagined things (a sore and maggots: patches of water and reflections thereon,
etc.) do not help dispel the personality-belief, and the deluded &quot;I&quot;
still persists in the happening of those six kinds of consciousness, insight is
still far beyond you. Only when your earlier ingrained concept of, &quot;I see
it&quot;, etc., loosens itself and the real occurrence of consciousness is
properly comprehended, firmly grasped can you ascertain yourself that you have gained
the Knowledge of being firmly settled about the Dhamma. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
arising and vanishing of phenomena take place at tremendous speed comparable to
the phenomenon of lightning; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
you have to make yourself aware of the fact that phenomena arise and vanish
rapidly within such fleeting moments as the blink of an eye. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
contemplation of impermanence, ill and not-self, is the way to break up the
diehard concepts of permanence, pleasurableness, and self or ego with their
erroneous belief in a being, person, or a life. When the ephemeral character of
all phenomena, not lasting even as long as the duration of a flash of
lightning, is seen through, the truth that such phenomena are not at all reliable
should become clear; and when this is thoroughly understood, the ill, the
not-self, the not-person, the not-life of the self-same phenomena will
automatically come to light. This understanding is no other than the Knowledge
of being established in the Dhamma. The fleeting nature of phenomena is
therefore aptly compared in the scriptures to a flash of lightning. The
rapidity of the occurrence of mental phenomena is even far greater: their
arisings and vanishings may be reckoned in hundreds of thousands of times
within a flash of lightning. The rapidity is beyond human comprehension.
Therefore it is not advisable to make such subtle phenomena one's object of
contemplation. Try as one might, these phenomena will not be comprehended even
after contemplating for a hundred or a thousand years. Instead of any ray of
insight the meditator will be beset by more befuddlement and despair. For, as
the scriptures say, mental phenomena take place in billions and trillions
within the blink of an eye, or a flash of lightning, or of the snapping of
one's fingers. Now, the duration of the blink of an eye itself is fleeting
enough. To attempt to contemplate the occurrence of mental phenomena to the
billionth or trillionth part of that duration would therefore be sheer folly.
That is why you should rest satisfied if you can comprehend the unreliable,
transient character of all phenomena, which is the main purpose. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
for the exact nature of mental phenomena, the understanding of which is the
domain of the All-knowing Buddha's Wisdom, one has only to accept the authority
of the scriptures (as to their swiftness). All talk about contemplating the
three characteristics of mental phenomena is mere humbug. It is never practical
but only hearsay from the Scriptures. If someone were to try it, it would be a
far cry from insight. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Four Great Elements of Earth <i>(pathavi),</i> Water <i>(apo), </i>Heat <i>(tejo),</i>
and Wind <i>(vayo):</i> and Space <i>(akasa),</i> these five material elements
are conditioned by the four factors, namely, volitional acts (kamma), mind <i>(citta)</i>,
temperature <i>(utu)</i> and nutriment <i>(ahara).</i> Further, they are
conditioned by the six sense-bases <i>(vatthu)</i> and their respective
sense-objects <i>(arammana).</i> So we have six basic elements which are caused
or conditioned by six basic phenomena (i.e., the four conditions governing
materiality plus (the set of) two conditions governing mentality). A good
understanding of these phenomena is required for one to gain the Light of
comprehending the Cause or Causality. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now,
each of the Four Great Elements, Earth, Water, Fire and Wind, arise by these four
conditions: (I)Volitional acts or Kamma, (2) Mind, (3) Temperature and (4)
Nutriment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
for Space <i>(akasa dhatu)</i> since it is not caused, i.e., 'not born' <i>(jati)</i>
it does not have any arising <i>(uppada).</i> It merely happens to exist to delimit
those conditioned material units <i>(rupa kalapa).</i> Hence one should not
look for the origin or cause of space. (In other words), we exclude space from
our study of the Law of Causality.[16] <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Of
the four causes of origination, Kamma means good kamma, such as giving or
morality (or virtue) etc., on the one hand, and bad kamma such as killing,
stealing, etc., on the other, done in previous existences. The following
material phenomena arise due to Kamma: (a) physical vitality <i>(jivita),</i>
(b) heart-base <i>(hadaya vatthu),</i> (c) female sex <i>(itthi bhava),</i> (d)
male sex <i>(pumbhava),</i> (e) eye-sensitivity <i>(cakkhu-pasada),</i> (f)
ear-sensitivity <i>(sotapasada),</i> (g) nose-sensitivity <i>(ghana pasada)</i>,
(h) tongue-sensitivity <i>(jivha pasada)</i> and (i) body-sensitivity <i>(kaya
pasada).</i> All those material phenomena are conditioned by past kamma alone.
For once <i>jivita,</i> or physical vitality, is destroyed in the present
existence no other present conditions - temperature, nutriment, or medicine or
medicinal diet, - could restore it to the body. This body dies and it is
conventionally said that the present existence expires and a new existence
comes to arise. It is the same thing with the heart-base. When eye sensitivity
is destroyed medicines or medicinal treatment cannot restore it,
Eye-sensitivity is lost forever. The same holds true for ear-sensitivity,
nose-sensitivity, tongue-sensitivity, and body-sensitivity. Thus, the
above-mentioned material phenomena, since their inception, are subject to
favourable conditions and circumstances for their continued existence
throughout their process of development. Once the process is interrupted, no
amount of present efforts can restore them. That is why they are said to be the
product or resultant of past kamma alone. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Among

etc. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Another
classification: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mind
or <i>citta</i> or consciousness is of these three classes: <br>
consciousness in bodily actions, in verbal actions and in mental actions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Of
those three classes: consciousness in bodily actions varies with the manner of
physical movement such as going, standing, sitting, lying down, bending,
stretching, etc. Consciousness in going means the volition that activates the
particular deportment. The activating consciousness that brings the foot to make
the first step is followed by that which brings the other foot to make another
step, and so each step is directed by each consciousness so that as long as
this type of consciousness is arising successively, the steps are made
successively. Likewise in all bodily movements, every little bit of movement is
brought about by each type of consciousness. As an illustration, take a railway
engine. Each puff of steam from inside the boiler turns the machinery in a
specific stroke, and each ball of smoke escapes from the chimney. Every stroke
of the machine's turning, every bulge of smoke at the chimney is the work of
each specific puff of steam. The same principle is observable in other steam
engines such as in power- generating plants and steamers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the same manner when you walk, every step that is made is on account of each
motivating consciousness accompanied by its own set of physical phenomena. The
consciousness that motivates the first step vanishes at the end of the step
when the physical phenomena of that step dies away. A fresh consciousness
arises for the next step, bringing in a fresh set of physical phenomena. This
second step ended, the physical phenomena therein vanish, and the motivating
consciousness is no more. In this way when a hundred steps are made a hundred
types of consciousness and a hundred sets of physical phenomena (arise and)
vanish. When a thousand steps are made, a thousand types of consciousness and
material states (arise and) vanish. The mentality and materiality pertaining to
the outgoing step have no effect on the succeeding step. They perish the moment
the particular step is made. At each step that is made fresh motions occur
throughout the body. All these motions represent fresh arisings of materiality
due to fresh arisings of consciousness. Every day we make innumerable bodily
movements: the head, the limbs and all the smaller parts of the body move in
various manners; the exhaling, the inhaling, the blinking of the eyes, the
movement of the lips, etc., take place all the time, each of which has its own
consciousness to account for the particular motion. This is how consciousness
in bodily actions brings about physical phenomena expressing themselves as
bodily actions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Consciousness
in verbal actions brings about physical phenomena expressing themselves as
verbal actions. Whether we speak or cry, laugh or shout, every minute utterance
is the work of a particular consciousness. For instance. we say: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Iti
pi so bhagava araham sammasambuddho&quot;</span></i><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'> each syllable - <i>I, ti, pi,</i> (etc.)
- is motivated by its own consciousness. If you say in English: &quot;Homage to
the Buddha&quot;, each of the syllables, -Hom - age - to - (etc.) - is caused
to be uttered by its own motivating consciousness. Observe this fact carefully.
And also observe that at the end of each syllable the motivating consciousness
for it vanishes. This is how consciousness in verbal actions brings about
physical phenomena (audible sounds) in verbal actions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Consciousness
in mental actions brings about physical phenomena expressing themselves as
visible aspects of one's mood, generally noticeable in the eyes, facial
expression and demeanour. Hence we can distinguish anger from the face that has
assumed, under angry impulse (consciousness), a reddish aspect. So also the
face assumes distinct expressions under the impulse of kindness, ill-will,
goodwill. and so on. Observe carefully that each mental action is behind each
material phenomenon that finds its outward expression. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
then is how the Four Great Elements that constitute physical phenomena change
millions of times under the impulses of consciousness that arise and vanish in
as many times each day in a given individual. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Whereas
the physical phenomena in walking is conditioned by the consciousness of
walking - i.e., the thought-impulses that bring about bodily movement called
walking - the generality of the people think someone goes, a woman goes, a man
goes, he goes, I go, etc.. This persistent view of the going as necessarily
done by some person. i.e.. the goer, is the Stark Ignorance of Causality. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
truth is that in the bodily movement of going, the consciousness that motivates
it is no person or being, no woman or man, not he, not I, not human, not a
deva. It is only the element of consciousness (<i>citta</i> or<i> vinnana</i>).
The act of going caused by the consciousness of going, is physical phenomena
set in motion. Apart from mentality-materiality there exists no person, no
being, no personal entity, no soul, no individual life, no woman, or man,
neither he nor I, that goes. So also there is the coming but no one who
actually comes; there is the standing but no one who stands; there is the
sitting but no one who sits, there is the sleeping but no one who sleeps, there
is the speaking but no one who speaks. In any act there is only the action but
no one who acts. There is no doer, no subject by way of a living entity. And
there is no creator. There is only the arising of physical phenomena expressing
themselves as going, coming, sitting, sleeping, speaking, etc., under the
motivating force or impulse of consciousness which is the true cause of all
such arisings. To be able to discern this truth is Knowledge in comprehending
the Law of Causality. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

that causes the arising of the Four Great Elements, i.e. the physical
phenomena, means cold <i>(sitatejo)</i> and heat <i>(unhatejo).</i> The element
of cold causes cold material to arise; the element of heat causes hot material
to arise. In the cold season the element of cold prevails making the body cold.
In the hot season the element of heat prevails making the body warm. In the
rainy season there is a mixture of cold and hot elements around us so that by
night the body is cold and by day it is warm. In the morning before noon the
body is warm; in the afternoon it is cold. When we stay or go about in the sun
the body gets hot, we feel warm and there is perspiration. In the shade the
body is cool, we do not feel warm, and it is comfortable. While sleeping or
sitting the body is cool. While standing or walking it gets warm. When there is
exertion - carrying things, digging or chopping things, etc., - the body gets
warm. And when the body rests it gets cool again. Thus within the day
innumerable physical phenomena, cold or hot, arise in a person, depending on
circumstances, all due to temperature. Observe carefully within yourself the
arisings of hot or cold materiality which occur in turns due to changes in
temperature. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

When one believes in the existence of a doer, one considers oneself, &quot;If I
wish to enjoy cool, I can make myself cool&quot;; or &quot;If I wish to make
myself warm, I can do so&quot;. (Corollary): when one believes of another who
begets the action of a doer, one considers as for oneself- &quot;As a result of

indicates belief in the wrong view of the existence of a person, a doer or a

food that is taken daily. That two square meals a day are required for man, and

elephants, etc., of the animal kingdom, is commonplace. Consider in yourself,
as well as in other living beings, how lack of food causes certain noticeable
physical characteristics, and how a timely meal causes other noticeable
physical characteristics. Hunger causes, as everyone knows, physical weakness:
a well-fed stomach causes a sense of physical wellbeing. Wrong food causes sickness
which is manifested in a sick body. The taking of medicine or medicinal diet
causes sickness to disappear, which is also manifested in a cured and healthy

<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
the eye comes into contact with a visual object, the impact produces in the
eye-base, eye-consciousness which in common usage is 'seeing' the (colour)
object. A ready example is the reflection of a face in a mirror. Herein, the
smooth surface of the mirror may be likened to the eye-base which is capable of
visual sentience. The face reflected in the mirror is like the visual object.
As the image of your face falls on the surface of the mirror it is reflected in
the mirror. So also, as the eye-sensitivity of the eye comes into contact with
some visual object within the range of the eye, eye-consciousness arises. When
your face turns away from the mirror, the reflection of your face in the mirror
disappears. Similarly, when the eye turns away from the visual object, eye-
consciousness disappears. You say you do not see it now. If you turn it towards
the object again, eye-consciousness arises again. And if you turn it away
again, it (eye-consciousness) disappears again. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now,
eye-consciousness or the consciousness of seeing is a phenomenon that arises
only while the eye is in contact with the object. When there is no contact no
eye-consciousness can arise in which case you say you do not see it. So what is
called seeing is only the function of eye-consciousness, which arises, in its
natural state of things <i>(dhammata),</i> due to contact between eye and
visual object. If there is no eye, or no sensitivity of the eye, no seeing is
possible. On the other hand. if there is no visual object within the range of
the eye-sensitivity, also, no seeing is possible - there is nothing to see. We
may note, then, that what is called seeing, or the arising of
eye-consciousness, is a temporary phenomenon -only a momentary occurrence <i>(agantukadhatu)</i>
- that is occasioned in the eye-base by the occurrence of contact between eye
and visual object. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
also:<br>
The arising of ear-consciousness or hearing takes place occasionally as and
when the ear-sensitivity in the ear and sound come into contact. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The arising
of nose-consciousness or smelling takes place occasionally as and when the
nose-sensitivity in the nostrils and odour come into contact. The arising of
tongue -consciousness or tasting takes place occasionally as and when the
tongue-sensitivity in the tongue and taste or sapidity come into contact. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
arising of body-consciousness or sensitivity of touch takes place throughout
the body from head to foot, externally as well as internally, occasionally as
and when the body-sensitivity and tactile objects of sorts - rough or soft, hot
or cold, etc., - come into contact. The body-sensitivity is wide and complex :
it may be just skin deep or it may be felt from the marrow to say nothing of an
assortment of aches, cramps, itchings, etc., now hot here or now cold there,
and so on. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
arising of mind-consciousness takes place in the heart-basis due to its contact

<i>(avarice);</i> or wholesome states such as faith, knowledge; or simply

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
inability to comprehend the truth that the six kinds of consciousness arise
each due to momentary contacts between the sense organs or sense-bases and
their respective objects; which is commonly spoken of as seeing, hearing,
smelling, tasting, touching and thinking and which are actually separate and
distinctive phenomena covering the whole set of the five aggregates, is Stark
Ignorance of the Dhamma, the First Stark Ignorance. The lack of understanding
of the origin of the six kinds of consciousness, that they arise on the dual
cause of sense-base and sense-object, is Stark Ignorance of Causality, the
Second Stark Ignorance. From this ignorance arises the wrong view of a doer or
a creator. This view firmly holds that for all actions there exists a doer, a
creator. In other words, all existence means persons and their doings. Personal
entity such as I or he/she, etc.. is responsible for seeing, hearing. etc.
&quot;I see with my eye&quot;, &quot;I hear with my ears&quot; - (as taught
when children) - are taken literally by the adult. This belief is the only
truth such an ignorant one holds : he rejects any other cause. All such views
that tenaciously hold to the idea of a doer or a creator are wrong. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
wrong view of <i>karaka ditthi</i> (in short) is the view that all the other
perceptions - hearing, tasting, touching, knowing, thinking - are also actions
done by someone. Without some person doing these things they cannot take place.
There is a person who sees, who hears, etc. This view does not accept that
these perceptions arise simply through the dual cause of sense-bases and
sense-objects. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
who comprehends the phenomena of the six kinds of consciousness that arise due

Light dispels once and for all the Stark Ignorance of Causality and the wrong
view of a doer or creator as the cause of life. Where one clings to the belief
that it is due to God, I see, I hear, etc., not knowing or not accepting the
phenomena of the dual cause of the six kinds of consciousness one also errs in
the wrong view of a doer/creator. The same ignorance lies at the root of the

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Of
the five material elements among those six (<i>vinnana</i> being a mental
element), <i>pathavi dhatu </i>is the key. For it is the very basis of all
materiality. It is on this element that the Great Earth with the great oceans,
mountains, countries and human settlements and structures are founded. If one
can comprehend the impermanence of the Great Earth and visualise its crumbling,
disintegration and vanishing (in one's mind), the ephemeral nature of all the
countries, cities and human settlements is seen without further effort. Similarly,
when the ultimate fact about <i>pathavi</i> as the basis of all materiality,
including the elements of Water, Wind and Fire, is understood as to its
unstable, ephemeral character, its constant state of decay, the remaining
elements constituting all material phenomena are seen without further effort. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Three Characteristics <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now,
to deal with the Three Characteristics: The Characteristic of Impermanence <i>(anicca
lakkhana)</i> is that which arises momentarily, only to vanish as soon as
having risen. It is called <i>anicca</i> because it is in the nature of
decaying and destruction <i>(khayatthena aniccam).</i> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
characteristic of Dreadfulness <i>(dukkha lakkhana)</i> is the danger that
lurks in the alluring attractions of material things. Just as a leper in
advanced stages does not dare to partake of rich delicious food but must
decline any offer of it, so also the wise are not attracted by material things.
For the apparent greatness and pleasures of human or celestial existence are
all fraught with the inherent danger of defilements which keep one in the
recurring process of ageing, decay and death. It is called <i>dukkha</i>
because of its nature of danger and dreadfulness <i>(bhayatthena dukkham).</i> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
characteristic of insubstantiality <i>(anatta lakkhana)</i> is the absence of
substance in materiality. No substance exists that can be called the essence of
a person. As we have seen in our discussion on Knowledge in being firmly
settled about the Dhamma, the ultimate truth of materiality and mentality
disproves the existence of a person - just as the basic structural materials
are only timber or bamboo and not house or monastery or temple or rest-house or
pandal. It is called anatta because it lacks substance or essence <i>(asarakatthena
anatta).</i> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Of
those Three Characteristics, the Characteristic of <i>dukkha</i> or woefulness
or ill, is exhausted only when one attains <i>Arahatta Magga,</i> the fourth
and final stage of the Path-Knowledge. The other two are exhausted at the lower
stages. Of these two, the worldling must first of all grapple with
Personality-belief, the belief in 'I', which is deluded and erroneous. For this
he must necessarily comprehend the not-self character <i>(anatta lakkhana)</i>
of all compounded things. This not-self character is in fact implicit in the
impermanent character: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So I
will now explain the impermanent character clearly with a view to throwing
light on the 'not-self' character. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Examining
Tejo dhatu <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
discussing the Knowledge of being firmly settled about the Dhamma we have been
acquainted with the six basic elements of materiality. We shall now begin with
examining <i>Tejo dhatu, </i>the Element of Heat or the Fire Element, its
impermanence and not -self (no-essence) characteristics. <i>Tejo</i> comprises
heat and cold which are known by the world as such but which are primary
elements that belong to <i>Tejo.</i> Now heat and cold are of opposite nature.
Each is the antithesis of the other. When cold prevails heat is absent and vice
versa. What the world calls a being or a person is born only once and dies only
once. There is no repeated arising of a person during his lifetime nor repeated
vanishings or cessations. <i>Tejo</i> which is a basic element in the body of
all living things, on the other hand, arises quite a number of times in a day,
and vanishes in as many times. We speak of : &quot;Oh, now it is no longer
warm: it is getting cool&quot;, or &quot;it is no longer cold; it is getting
warm now&quot; - and these we say even during the course of any single day.
That being so, <i>Tejo</i> arises and vanishes in its own way, whereas what is
believed to be a person, an individual, does not have the same arisings and
vanishings. No identity exists between <i>Tejo</i> and the assumed personal
entity of a being. So it is erroneous in the Abhidhamma sense to speak of
someone feeling warm or cold when <i>tejo</i> becomes hot or cold. It gets warm
or cold as a mere phenomenon of <i>Tejo,</i> no one is feeling warm or cold in
the ultimate sense. For apart from that phenomenon there is no person, no
personal entity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Since
the so-called person or being does not in the ultimate sense correspond to <i>tejo,</i>
a basic element with its own characteristic properties, it is evident that
neither heat nor cold is a person, a being. Neither of them connotes a person,
a being. If it were so, then the same phenomenon of arisings and vanishings
should hold true both to <i>tejo</i> and to the so-called person. If <i>tejo</i>
were a person then it should also, like the so-called person, decease only once
in a person's lifetime. As a matter of fact, <i>tejo</i> arises and vanishes
many times a day and also turns from hot to cold every now and then. The
changes are also noticeable. We know when it is hot, and we know when the heat
vanishes. So also we know when it is cold, and we know when the cold vanishes.
If this phenomenon of hot and cold were indeed a person then we would consider
that that person arises and vanishes every time heat or cold arises and
vanishes. That however is not the case. While noticing that heat and cold arise
many times and vanish many times a day, we generally do not consider that a
person arises and vanishes in as many times a day. We hold the view that a
person, once born, dies only once in his lifetime. So the incongruity is plain
enough. Heat or cold cannot be one and the same thing as a person. Heat or cold
do not belong to a person; they cannot be called the substance of a person.
They are not person, not self. They are merely the Element of <i>Tejo.</i> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is the impermanent and the not-self character of <i>Tejo.</i> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
fact of the numerous vanishings, even in the course of a day, is the character
of impermanence <i>(aniccalakkhana).</i> Since material phenomena have the
inherent character of constant decay and vanishing it is not something
substantial that can be called a person or a being. It is a vain thing that
does not exist really. Hence it has the character of voidness, not-self <i>(anattalakkhana).</i>
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>By
saying that there is no substance we mean that if the phenomenon of heat or
cold be taken as a person, then one is assuming that phenomenon as a substance.
In that case one believes that heat or cold represents a personal entity. In
other words, one believes in the existence of a self <i>(atta).</i> Now, if
heat or cold were a person that has a 'self', then either of them should remain
unchanged till his death. The fact is that heat or cold changes every moment,
regardless of the so-called person who has no control over it. Since that
'person' cannot rely on heat or cold as his own self <i>(atta),</i> it is
evident that heat or cold has no self <i>(anatta).</i> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Certain
beings live a hundred years. The heat-and-cold in such a person does not remain
constant throughout the hundred years of his life. It does not remain so even
for ninety years, nor for eighty years, nor for seventy years, -, ten years, -,
five years, four years, nor one year. Therefore it is clear that heat or cold
is not his own self. It is not a self at all. I have repeated myself but then
this is a very subtle matter that must be grasped. Bear on this point with all
your mind and strive to gain insight. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Origination and Character of the Four Great Elements in Combination <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four great elements of Earth, Water, Wind and Fire have been compared to
reflections that appear in a mirror. They may be likened to a rainbow appearing
while sunlight is passing through a vapoury sky. The emphasis is on their
ephemeral character. They arise due to the four main causes - <i>Kamma,</i>
mind, temperature and nutriment - and vanish due to the same causes. If that
transient nature of all materiality has been grasped. when one contemplates on
one's body, the same phenomena will be observed. Not the blink of an eye passes
without the arisings of fresh materiality occurring there only to decay and
disappear as soon as arisen. Those arisings and vanishings take place not
unlike the frothing, turbulent. steamy water in a big boiler where the froth
forms and disappears in no time. Just as a confused succession of bubbles are
formed and are dying out, so also the arisings and vanishings of the Four Great
Elements in the body will be discerned, all caused and conditioned by the four
main factors of <i>Kamma,</i> etc., of which the role of nutriment will be seen
most vividly. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Conditioned
by <i>kamma,</i> mind, temperature and nutriment, there arise in the body the element
of hardness called <i>Pathavi</i> or Earth Element. the element of cohesion
called <i>Apo</i> or Water Element; the element of life-sustaining heat called <i>Tejo</i>
or Fire Element; and the element of motion and support called <i>Vayo</i> or
Wind Element. None of the four elements possesses any substance even so much as
an atom. All are mere properties or functions. Therefore when any one of them
decays all of them are destroyed at once. If the Element of Fire goes out, the
qualities of hardness, cohesion, sustaining heat and motion die out
instantaneously. They cannot survive even for the blink of an eye. If the Earth
Element fails, all the elements lose their basis and so the qualities of
cohesion, heat or cold, motion or distension, all disappear. Watch these
happening in your body, closely. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
decaying materiality is instantly replaced by successive arisings of fresh
matter at such a rapid rate that tens of thousands of changes take place within
the blink of an eye, or a flash of lightning. The rapidity cannot be visible to
the physical eye. The arisings and vanishings going on in a state of flux can
only be discerned through insight, contemplating their ultimate nature as
explained above. In this state of flux, seen in mental perception, every
movement represents the change taking place between the old and the new. To the
physical eye, an apparently permanent object is seen as making no movements. If
one is not wiser than what the eye can see one is still a far cry from the
ultimate truth -a point that needs to be taken to heart. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
the four main causes that bring about the arising of the properties of
hardness, cohesion, etc., of the Earth Element, Water Element, etc., - undergo
a change, the co-existent Fire Element fails, which brings about the instant
cessation of all materiality that make up a given unit of materiality. How this
comes about will be explained now. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Fire,
as we know it from everyday experience, arises dependent on some other matter
and consumes that matter. That is the very nature of fire. So also Fire Element
as an ultimate fact of materiality arises dependent on the three other Elements
of hardness, cohesion and support; and consumes them all in no time. Fire that
burns on garbage burns it up into ashes instantly. Fire that burns on oil burns
up its fuel-oil. So also fire that burns on kerosene consumes the kerosene.
Whatever fuel the fire happens to be fed on, it devours it all at once. Much in
the same way, the Element of Fire that burns in all beings throughout the body
devours co-existent Elements, and this process takes place very rapidly all the
time without pause. More particularly, the devouring of nutriment is more
voracious. That being the case, all materiality, be it the Element of Earth or
the Element of Water, cannot last even as long as the blink of an eye or a
flash of lightning. Within such short moments they all vanish forever, hundreds
of thousands of times. Every such decaying materiality is instantly replaced so
that the growth and development of childhood into adulthood is made possible. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the quest for truth you have to try and visualise in your mental faculty the
incessant phenomena of decay throughout your body. If you can visuaiise the
state of flux in you quite vividly, you will perceive vividly how the whole
body is made up of new arisings or origination of materiality as well as the
constant decay, the truth of the impermanence of all things. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
lamp with a fuel-can containing one viss of kerosene burns up the whole one
viss before it dies out. Before the can is empty someone refills it with fuel.
So long as this refuelling is kept up the fuel-can does not seem diminished in
its contents, nor does the flame appear to have diminished in intensity. Yet
the fact stands that both the fuel and the flame feeding on it are dying out every
moment. If it were otherwise there would have been no need for replenishing the
oil. If, supposing the lamp is kept alight the whole night, and fifty viss of
kerosene oil is being used up, this amount is evidently -what has been consumed
by the fire. The fact of the flame consuming its fuel is noticeable to the keen
observer. The passing moments of the flame getting weaker before the fuel is
replenished as it gets low, is observable too. And it is everybody's knowledge
that to keep the lamp alight the whole night it costs some considerable amount
of kerosene. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
same holds true with living things. It is the regular meals that supply the
fuel for the body. A meal provides the necessary fuel for a certain number of
hours keeping the body whole after which the pinch of hunger comes to be felt.
After some time without food the body cannot function. As the decay of the body
is so fast, so also the fresh arising of materiality, replacing the old, also
is equally fast. This rapid process of the necessity of fresh matter to replace
the worn-out and deceased matter, forces living beings to be in constant search
of food. That is why the task of keeping this mind/body process going is the
most serious task, a compulsive action that is not only demanding but often
exacting. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Imagine
the amount of food produced in our Southern Island Continent <i>(Jambudipa),</i>
cereals, grains, and other edible crops, in the course of one year. and
apportion it into monthly quotas for consumption by the population, and then
break it down into daily requirements. Think of the magnitude of the daily food
consumption. It represents the scale of material replenishment that is being
met every day. This enormity of the daily food intake required to keep
ourselves alive, so that the material phenomenon inside us is kept regularly
replenished will indicate the enormous rate of decay that is overtaking us. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Think
of the law of the jungle, the law of &quot;fish eat fish&quot;, all reflecting
the fundamental fact of keeping oneself fed so as to live. Think of the human
drudgery, day in and day out in eking out one's livelihood, amidst all sorts of
struggles, the sweating away at one's job; the planning and schemings, the
travel and expeditions. the arguments and hagglings, the disputes and fights,
the security and precautions, the frettings and fumings, the stress and strain,
the cares and woes - all these just for the sake of preserving one's precious
little life. If one can contemplate all these, down to their root-cause, the
dire necessity of sustaining the body by providing fresh fuel in place of the
consumed fuel will be realised. The compulsiveness of keeping oneself alive
through nutriment will be seen. When one is able to understand this compulsive
nature of staying alive through fresh fuelling, then the rate of consumption of
what has been fed into the body will be appreciated. Then the ephemeral
character of the body will be seen; the utter helplessness will be seen; the
sheer absence of self will be seen. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
short, all the cares that beset living things in the world are due to the
rapidity of arising and decay of all material phenomena, big or small, taking
place in the body. This is the natural order of things in their origination -
the impermanence and not-self character in the natural state of things - which
needs to be comprehended. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Attachment
to one's body is usually strong. Everybody would like to live a hundred years,
or even a thousand years (if possible). This entails sustaining the
ever-decaying body by means of fresh fuel so that fresh materiality is caused
to arise to take the place of decayed matter. If one comprehends the arising of
fresh materiality, due to the fresh feedings in the natural state of the body,
and realises its transience and not-self character, lacking reality or substance
even in the natural form, then it will not be too difficult to comprehend the
altered condition <i>(vikati)</i> of the arising of materiality, the transience
in the altered state of things, the dissolution <i>(bhijjnam),</i> the
diminution <i>(khayo),</i> the destruction <i>(vayo),</i> the emptiness or
insubstantiality <i>(asaro)</i> of the altered state of things. By altered
conditions that arise <i>(vikati jati)</i> is meant the occurrence of ailments
and diseases, dangers, enemies, suffering from violence <i>(dando)</i> and
accidents or misfortunes <i>(upaddavo).</i> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That
the materiality that composes the body is subject to the ravages of all those
dangers and mishaps, and that they are decaying and dying out incessantly
should also be seen. This is called &quot;impermanence due to extraneous
causes&quot; <i>(vikati anicca).</i> So also the nature of insubstantiality on
the same account <i>(vikati anatta)</i> should be seen. The fresh arisings
occur incessantly; there is no lapse between the decayed matter and fresh
matter, the process is continuous every moment. Therefore it is possible for
desirable materiality and undesirable materiality to arise in turns at any
moment, throughout the whole body. And since the deterioration and decay is
also occurring very swiftly, sudden turns from being well to unwell, being
pleasant to unpleasant, are also possible. In fact there is never a moment when
such turns from good to bad cannot occur. For every moment is filled with
arisings and vanishings. All fresh arisings are, in the ultimate sense, fresh
births <i>(jati).</i> When, for instance, we say we have an eye-sore, or an
ear-sore, this is the arising or birth of some unpleasant feeling. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
disappearance is called Impermanence <i>(anicca),</i> for what has arisen does
not last even a moment but deteriorates, decays and dies out. In common usage
we say, &quot;The cold is no more, it is gone&quot;. These are but instances of
Impermanence. By not-self <i>(anatta)</i> is meant the unsubstantial character
of all things, not actually existing but only in a state of flux. In common
parlance we hear such expressions as: &quot;Pleasure does not last, it is only
momentary&quot;; or &quot;The cold lasts just a while&quot;; &quot;Beauty is
not lasting&quot;; or &quot;The stiffness is gone now&quot;: etc. All these
expressions denote the transient nature of all compounded things. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
this body countless factors are ever present to bring to extinction all good or
bad, i.e. desirable or undesirable, states, and these factors are both
intrinsic as well as extrinsic. The Buddha calls <i>Pathav,</i> Earth Element,
the bad snake with the poisonous mouth <i>(katthamukha).</i> As the snake bites
the tip of a toe the poison instantly reaches the head, making the victim
unconscious. The whole body undergoes a tremendous change from the normal
condition to a searing physical condition all at once. Not a trace of the
normal healthy physical condition is left in them. The whole body is now filled
with a frightfully heated physical phenomena. It may be likened to a big bomb
filled with (say), fifty viss of high explosive, which, when exposed to a tiny
fire through its firing point turns the entire contents of explosive into a
powerful mass of fire. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
normal physical condition of the victim, beginning from his soles, was in a
good or desirable state. This is quite evident. The burning heat, the pain, the
aching, the stabbing sensation, the cramp, the spasm, the convulsion, the
numbness and stiffness caused by snake venom, is a later occurrence bringing
severe discomfort and distress. This too, is evident. If the victim be asked he
would say that this pain is caused from outside and was not there before. However,
this knowledge is crude, superficial. For people do not understand the arising
of fresh physical phenomena, they do not know that the earlier healthy physical
condition, the old materiality, has decayed. They are quite ignorant of the
impermanent nature of material phenomena. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Any
fresh feeling or sensation that is noticed in one's body, any arising of pain
or disease, all mean fresh origination of physical phenomena, fresh elements,
fresh units of materiality, fresh facts in the ultimate sense. And all such
fresh origination takes place only to replace where the old elements, units of
materiality, the old facts, have faded away into nothingness. All this
phenomena of instability and cessation should be properly understood as the
character of impermanence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
a hot sensation is felt to arise in any part of the body, or throughout the
whole body, it is fresh materiality that has taken birth. Wherever fresh
arising occurs the fact of previous matter having decayed should be understood.
When the whole body is perceptibly turning hot then one has to understand that
the previous materiality, elements, units of physical phenomena, have decayed
and vanished. The rate of change from old to new, however, is too swift to be
noticeable. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sometimes
we feel cold; sometimes we feel some pain or ache or numbness or stiffness or
sprain; sometimes there is itching or irritation - all sorts of unpleasant
sensations are felt in our body, now here, now there. Wherever such sensations
occur one should perceive that this occurrence signifies dissolution of old
materiality, making it possible for fresh materiality to arise or originate. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It is
on account of these extraneous causes of the arising of physical phenomena and
their transience which are liable to befall one at any moment, that one is
never free from worry. Even in the midst of pleasurable enjoyment of life,
there looms this prospect of external causes leading to an abrupt change for
undesirable states. The range of mishaps is infinite; people live in constant
worry about disease, accidents, enemies, etc., and have to be always on guard
against them, never enjoying a really carefree moment. Fences, alarm-signals,
watchdogs, sentries, volunteer defence corps, etc., are symbols of a sense of
insecurity. Even so, many a time people are obliged to sleep in a hidden spot,
travel incognito, so as to fool the would-be enemy. When one contemplates these
cares and worries attending us all the time, one should appreciate how
burdensome this body is, what a great liability, what evil<i> (dukkha).</i> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
is an explanation showing the sudden swift change and corruption of Earth
Element which is the basis of the physical body, as illustrated by the Buddha
by the poisonous (mouthed) snake, on the analogy of a snake-bite victim, and a
bomb. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
is said about Earth Element, by implication. also should be noted as applying
to Water Element, Fire Element and Wind Element, the co-existent elements in
any unit of materiality. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
shall expand this statement now. Imagine a hard block of lac or wax or tallow
the size of man. Expose it to fire thoroughly inside and out. Try to visualise
the process of the lump melting away - how the hardness is giving way to
softness, from moment to moment. Then imagine the fire being withdrawn from the
lump, and try to visualise the reverse process - how the softness is giving way
to hardness, from moment to moment. The yielding of hardness, stage by stage
till there is no hardness left there, is, in <i>Abhidhamma</i> parlance, the
deterioration, disintegration and dissolution or decease of <i>(Pathavi)</i>
Earth Element. The same phenomena has been referred to in various terms in the <i>Suttanta</i>
and the <i>Abhidhamma</i> teachings such as: cessation <i>(nirodha),</i>
dissolution <i>(bhanga),</i> diminution <i>(khayo),</i> destruction <i>(vayo),</i>
passing away <i>(attha),</i> decease <i>(maranam), </i>impermanence <i>(anicca).</i>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If

Water Element, the Fiery-mouthed <i>(Aggimukha) </i>snake or Fire Element and
the Sword-mouthed <i>(Satthamukha)</i> snake or Wind Element. You will
understand that these elements, too, are corruptive, decaying and constantly
changing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>With
Water Element, as it gets stronger the cohesiveness gets stronger stage by
stage, and as it gets weaker cohesion gets weaker stage by stage until it
disintegrates. These changes illustrate that in <i>Apo</i> is inherent the
nature of cessation, dissolution, diminution, destruction, passing away,
decease, impermanence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>With Fire
Element, as it gets stronger the degree of heat gets stronger stage by stage,
and as it gets weaker, heat is replaced by cold, and the cold gets colder or
less cold by stages, as the case may be. These changes illustrate that in Tejo
is inherent the nature of cessation, dissolution, diminution, destruction,
passing away, decease, impermanence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>With

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mind-Consciousness
<i>(manovinnana)</i> is usually misunderstood as permanent. It is believed to
be lying in the heart all the time as a vital force or 'life'. having a

burning Personality -belief, the Wrong View that is going to drag one down to
the <i>niraya</i> world at one's death. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mind-Consciousness
has the heart <i>(hadayavatthu)</i> as its physical basis. In the heart there
is a handful and a half of blood which is continuously agitated like a spring
due to the digestive heat <i>(pacakatejo)</i> lying below it and the
life-preserving heat <i>(usma)</i> that is diffused throughout the whole body.
The materiality known as the heart-basis <i>(hadayavatthu)</i> as millions of
units, floats there in the constantly oozing stream of blood. Mind-Consciousness
arises from that material base in a continuous process of flux. As it arises it
originally has a dazzling luminosity. This radiant quality of
Mind-Consciousness is described by the Buddha in such statements as: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
lustre of Mind Consciousness is, however, not physically visible. It is to be
perceived only. One may try to visualise it with benefit, provided such

contact with it. A micro-organism of extremely delicate nature, dazzling white
that is born in the liquid by its own nature, now arises here, now there, and
makes as if to move violently; but even before the movement can take place it
is dissolved in the red liquid and disappears within the blink of an eye.
Visualise the continuous appearance of the bacteria, now here, now there, and
their instantaneous disappearance. The arising and vanishing of
Mind-Consciousness is taking place just like that - mere flashes, or rather, a
series of flashes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
rapidity of the rising and falling is so pronounced that wherever one focuses
the mind on the heart-base the whole surface of the clear red blood will be
marked by a continuous succession of these arisings and fallings as if in a state
of oscillation. The tenacious conventional concept of &quot;I know&quot;,
&quot;I think&quot;, etc., holding <i>vinnana</i> or Mind as one's own self,
must now be readily identifiable with this oscillating phenomenon. If, in spite
of such visualisation, the old deluded belief in a lasting soul or self
-&quot;I know&quot;, &quot;I think&quot;, - still persists, the knowledge is
not real, it is still superficial. Therefore do not let that die-hard belief,
the passport to the hellish fires of <i>niraya,</i> linger in your thought.
When you try and understand the changing phenomenon of mind-consciousness at
the heart-base, give your attention also to what has all along been taken for
granted as your thought. Then (slowly) you will realise that there is none of
your thought there, in reality. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the hot season before the rains arrive, natural reservoirs lie as wide stretches
of parched land with cracks showing everywhere. In the mid-day sun these dry
unvegetated stretches, when viewed from a distance, present a shimmering sea
not unlike a vast expanse of water. Herds of thirsty deer, numbered by the
thousand in search of very scarce water, think of the mirage appearing before
them as water and rush for it. But as they get to the scorched bed of the
reservoir the imagined water seems still some distance away. They try to get
there but there is no water. Then they turn back and see the same phenomenon in
the centre of the reservoir. They run back to the centre. The water is not
there; it again seems to lie yonder, to where they again rush. In this way
there is the endless delusion and the endless search for water where there is
no water at all. All perish there in the vain attempt. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

to play on the rising heat. In contemplating Mind-consciousness one has to
remember this elusive phenomenon. For the Mind-constituents <i>(namakkhandha)</i>
i.e. vinnana and the incorporeal factors arise constantly, being inclined to
mental objects, and perish as swiftly as the vapourous heat: and they lack

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Herein
'visual objects' is the <i>Abhidhamma</i> parlance. It is an abstract term. To
demonstrate what it means, one has to resort to the eight essential properties
of matter that constitute a certain physical unit. &quot;Visual object called
man&quot;, &quot;visual object called cow&quot;, &quot;visual object called
log&quot;, &quot;visual object called post&quot;, etc., are <i>Abhidhamma </i>terms.
&quot;I see a man&quot;, &quot;I see a cow&quot;, &quot;I see a log&quot;,
&quot;I see a post&quot;, etc., are common usage. Even in the <i>Abhidhamma</i>
there are certain terms which are coined in concrete terms, like <i>kabalikarahara</i>
(lit., a morsel) for material food. Such usage is called <i>(saratthukakatha)</i>
'expressions in concrete terms'. When concretised, the meaning becomes clear.
So in the <i>Abhidhamma</i> there are such concretised terms or <i>vohdrakatha</i>
(common usage) interspersed between abstract terms in the ultimate sense <i>(paramattha
katha).</i> For instance in the <i>Dhammasangani</i> we come across such words
as rice <i>(odano),</i> malt gruel <i>(kummaso),</i> meal <i>(sattu),</i> fish <i>(maccho),</i>
meat <i>(mansam),</i> etc. Material food is compounded of eight essential
elements (as in any unit of matter), out of which 'nutritive essence' <i>(oja)</i>
is one. The term <i>kabalikara</i> is another <i>Ahhidhamma</i> term for that
particular element. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Since
concrete terms are more readily understandable I shall use them here. By
'visual objects' that are seen occasionally, we mean things that happen to come
within sight which have been noticed. From your rising in the morning till
going to bed in the evening, things seen may be noted down serially, but the
seeing is actually too varied and complex. It is varied because there are just
too many to take count. It is complex because in seeing just one thing - say a
man - which part is seen first (his back?), which second (his head?) and so on.
It is to cover this infinite range of seeing that 'visual objects' are said to
be 'seen occasionally'. The essence here is, in this seeing, or rather process
of seeing, each object is a case for the arising and vanishing of each
eye-consciousness, one following the other in rapid succession. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Let
me expand on this statement. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
one comes within the seeing range of (say) a log, the image of the log is at once
reflected on the eye-sensitivity. In the ultimate reality of things the impact
of this image falling on the eye- sensitivity is considerable: it has been
compared to the striking of a thunderbolt. Eye-consciousness arises due to this
rude shock i.e., as and when the image falls on the eye-base. The phenomenon
may be likened to the sparks coming out as steel strikes flint in a lighter.
The image disappears every time the eye blinks, and at each disappearance of
the image eye-consciousness dies out instantly. It needs no mention that the
image disappears when the eye turns away from the object. And when the blink of
the eye is completed, and the eye Is still fixed on the object, the image
strikes again on the eye-sensitivity, causing fresh eye-consciousness to arise.
In this way eye-consciousnesss happens in a series. Take careful note of the
fresh arising every time. When the eye turns away from the log to the post the
same thing happens: the image of the log disappears and eye-consciousness of
the log vanishes; the image of the post appears and eye-consciousness of the
post arises. When the eye turns away from the post to some other object, again
the same thing happens. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So it
should be understood that eye-consciousness arises as and when each visual object
is noticed; each consciousness being due to each act of noticing it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Eye-consciousness
can arise only due to the impact of the image falling on eye-sensitivity.
Hence, the text mentions, &quot;on account of visual objects&quot;.Thus
eye-consciousness in seeing a log is caused by the log; eye-consciousness in
seeing a post is caused by the post. In other words, eye-consciousness caused
by the log makes you see the log, eye-consciousness caused by the post makes
you see the post. Let your understanding be clear about it - in all your acts
of seeing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
take a simile:A certain woman living during a world-period when the human
life-span is a hundred-thousand years, is widowed after her first year of
marriage: and during her marriageable life of fifty-thousand years she
remarries and each time she does so her husband dies after one year only. By
each husband she begets a child. In this way she has married fifty-thousand
husbands altogether and begotten as many children. Now, when we wish to refer
to these fifty-thousand children we cannot identify them with reference to the
mother, so we have to refer to the respective fathers - &quot;as Mr. so and
so's child&quot;. Eye-sensitivity is like the mother, visual objects such as
log, post, etc., are like the fifty-thousand fathers: each eye-consciousness is
like the fifty thousand offspring. That is why the Buddha says : &quot;Through
the coincidence of eye and visual object the offspring of evil desire is
begotten&quot;. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Therefore
it is quite true to speak of someone seeing the log through the
eye-consciousness born of the log, seeing the post through the
eye-consciousness born of the post, etc., in respect of everything he may
happen to see from the moment of his rising to his retiring for the night. Take
another simile: Someone runs holding a big glass block along a path flanked by
young trees, (say) a thousand on either side, about man's height. As he passes
through the trees their images fall in turn on the glass block. Eye-sensitivity
is like the glass block: the various trees are like the various visual objects;
and the images of the trees failing in their turn on the moving glass block are
like eye-consciousness. The appearance of the image of each tree causing a
specific eye-consciousness, and the disappearance thereof, represent the
phenomenon of eye-consciousness. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

etc. Besides, visual objects, sounds, smells, etc., i.e. the five sensual
objects, cannot be known without the functioning of mind-consciousness.
Mind-consciousness therefore receives impressions via the five physical senses
as well as receiving mental objects. In these six ways the objects of
mind-consciousness arise all the time. They belong to the past, the present and
the future. The past experiences beginning from the time one is born to the
present moment constitute past impressions. All anticipated ideas pertaining to
the future, even extending limitlessly into future existences, also work on
mind-consciousness. Besides, all second-hand knowledge pertaining to the six
senses one has leamt from others also comes within the cognition of
mind-consciousness. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mental
conceptions rise and fall incessantly in mind-consciousness. Even while asleep
the mind in its passive state, which is the 'life continuum' <i>(bhavanga),</i>
directs its attention to either past <i>kamma</i>,the sign of one's past<i>
kamma </i>or the sign of one's destination or future existence <i>(gati
nimitta).</i> Throughout the waking hours, from rising to retiring for the
night and falling asleep, any one of the six sense objects impresses on mind-
consciousness, each in its turn according to circumstance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mind-consciousness
takes place in a process. The passive state <i>(bhavanga)</i> of the mind must
receive certain sense impulses through one of the six senses before
mind-consciousness arises in the process. The impulse having been received, the
mind adverts to it. Then only is it recognised - cognition takes place. On
cognition, the thought process carries on: full knowledge of the same occurs,
and consequent thoughts based on that knowledge follow. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is never a break in the reception of sense impressions of one sort or the other
at the heart-basis. In fact a horde of them is always present at its door,
seeking entry. Hence the series of registering these goes on without a break.
These objects of the mind appear and disappear instantly, causing a distinct
mind-consciousness which rises and falls every time for each such occasion.
This goes on ceaselessly. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Ceaseless'
is the word in the worldly sense as the uninformed average person thinks. As a
matter of fact, each kind of consciousness takes place only at its respective
sense-base; it does not take place in any other part of the body. That is to
say, when eye-consciousness takes place the whole mental phenomena occur at the
eye only, not anywhere else. The whole mental phenomena, which consists of the
four aggregates of mentality <i>(namakkhandhas)</i> comprising feeling <i>(vedanakkhandha),</i>
perception <i>(sannakkhandha), </i>mental formations <i>(sankharakkhandha) </i>and
consciousness <i>(vinnanakkhandha),</i> mind or mind-consciousness <i>(citta)</i>
and the fifty-two mental concommitants <i>(cetasikas)</i> rise together and
fall together at the eye-base before another kind of consciousness can occur at
another sense-base. So when consciousness is occurring at the ear-base it does
not occur anywhere else, and the same holds true for all the six sense-bases.
When body-consciousness takes place at a certain spot on the body, the whole
mental phenomena arise and fall at that particular spot only. When
mind-consciousness takes place at the heart-basis the whole mental phenomena
arise and fall only at the heart-basis and nowhere else. However, since the
mental processes take place in astonishing rapidity, we normally think there is
a simultaneous consciousness taking place over the whole body. Even while one
thinks that one is seeing something, the eye-consciousness is being interrupted
by mind-consciousness at the heart-basis which can take place innumerable
times. So also, if there is occasion, ear-consciousness or other kinds of
consciousness can arise. For instance, while seeing a moving car, one hears the
sound of its engine, smells the fumes from its exhaust, etc., while the mind is
thinking about whose car it is, where it is going, and so on. These are all
what people think. The same process applies to the five other senses, it should
be understood. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
regards the active comprehension of Mind-consciousness, the same principle
holds. Consciousness that conditions bodily action cannot at the same time be
the consciousness that conditions verbal action. Consciousness that conditions
verbal action cannot at the same time be the consciousness that conditions
bodily action. However, the rapidity of consciousness is such that the
switching off and on of consciousness between bodily and verbal actions is not
normally noticed. So we think that while we are walking we can also be talking,
or while talking, we can also make bodily movements, as well as we see things
or hear sounds. These seemingly simultaneous occurrences in fact are distinct
occurrences with their own risings and fallings, only too swift to be noticed.
Although this phenomenon of fleeting consciousness <i>(vinnana)</i> may
actually run into millions and millions within the blink of an eye, the
practising yogi only needs to comprehend all of these occurrences as distinct
phases of rising <i>(udaya)</i> and falling <i>(vaya).</i> The insight into
flux is what must be developed. The purpose of insight-development <i>(vipassana)</i>
is to have first-hand knowledge to dispel the long-cherished delusion of the
belief in a non-existent person or ego, all the time being conscious of I, such
as &quot;I see, I hear, I smell, I taste, I touch, I know, I think&quot; - the
six kinds of deluded sensual perceptions paving the way to the hellish fires of
<i>(niraya),</i> as well as, I speak, I move, I go, I come&quot;, etc., - all
symptoms of Stark Ignorance of the Three Characteristics of Existence. By being
mindful of the mental and physical phenomena in a flux of states constantly
occurring within oneself, and observing them clearly at the six sense-bases of
eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and heart-basis, one becomes fully aware of when
and how they rise and fall. This is what must be aimed at. Once the arisings
and vanishings are clearly seen, from moment to moment, all the infinite
actions - bodily, verbal and mental - are covered. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
such insight has been properly developed the ephemeral nature of all material
and mental elements - the Four Great Elements of Earth, Water, Wind, Fire; as
also the Element of Space, the Element of Consciousness (the Six basic
elements) - will be perceived as mere bubbles or foam, impermanent and
insubstantial. Their continuous arising and falling from moment to moment will
be perceived. Thus the ever-present origination, decay, ageing and death, the
essential transitoriness will be perceived. This perception is the Light of

&quot;Thought-conception <i>(vitakka)</i> is the laying hold of thought, giving

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>First
of all, <i>Vitakka, </i>generally speaking, is different in its phase and
function, as to mundane and supramundane, literally strict sense, and common
usage. U Shwe Zan Aung gives an extensive explanation regarding <i>Cetasika,</i>
especially <i>Vitakka.</i> Compendium of Philosphy<i>(Abhidhammatthasangaha) </i>transl.
by U Shwe Zan Aung, B.A. (P.T.S. 1910, p.238 et seq.). In commentaries such as
the <i>'Visuddhimagga',</i> the <i>'Atthasalini'</i> the 'Abhidhammatvibhavani'
etc. the common characteristics of <i>Vitakka</i> is given like this: <i>'Cetaso
abhiniropanalakkhana'</i> (directing and lifting the <i>citta</i> and <i>cetasikas</i>
towards the objects). In the higher states of mind <i>Vitakka</i> serves as an
initial application, lifting up <i>citta</i> towards a wisdom which is
conducive to extirpation of defilements in the case of Path and Fruition <i>(Magga/Phala)</i>
and directing <i>citta</i> towards ecstatic concentration <i>(Appana Samadhi)</i>
which is capable of keeping hindrances off, in the case of <i>Jhana</i> or
Sublime <i>(Mahaggata)</i> fields. But in general common usage <i>Vitakka</i>
means applied or speculative thought or thinking over various aspects of
divergent objects <i>(Nanappakaraparikappana),</i> or 'day-dream' in the most
colloquial language. As regards temperaments <i>Vitakka,</i> as one type of <i>'cariya'</i>
called &quot;Speculative Temperament&quot; is explained in detail in the Path
of Purification (see pp 102-112). In the Burmese version of Ledi Sayadaw's
&quot;Alin Kyan&quot;. this sort of <i>Vitakka </i>is meant. so your rendering
&quot;random thought&quot; and &quot;idle thought&quot; is also right. But
&quot;Simply wool -gathering&quot; I do not think to be a suitable phrase to
convey such meaning. Ven. Sayadaw U Nyanika. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
