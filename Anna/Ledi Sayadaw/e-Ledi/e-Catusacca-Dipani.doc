following manner: in the beginning, it burdens the being by way of sankhata, in

methods of burden in the beginning, in the middle and at the end, manifest themselves
as the state of pilanattha. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I.
The Burden of Dukkha in the Brahma World<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>By
way of sankhata at the beginning means: to attain the five khandha of the
Brahma world (i.e. to be born in Brahma world), one has to practise for jhana
and samapatti in his previous existence, This endeavour to attain such states
is the heavy burden of sankhata at the beginning. Such attainments can be
achieved only by one who lives in remote places such as in forests and on
mountains, and takes severe austerities unbearable for an ordinary man. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>By
way of santapa in the middle means: when a being achieves the khandha of a
Brahma as the resultant effect of his having reached samapatti (attainments)
while in the world of men, his body and mind are incessantly burdened by the superiority
conceit of 'I am' 'I am.' In the same manner, other evils, such as sassatadi</span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Foreign1'>tt</span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>hi (eternalist theory), uccheda-di</span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Foreign1'>tt</span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>hi (annihilationist theory), mada
(intoxication with sensual pleasures in the Brahma plane), pamada (negligence
of the dhamma) and the defilements are burdening him by way of 'santapa'
(burning; heat; fire). When a Brahmna is being burdened by the ten kinds of
defilements, he does not perceive the weight of that burden. He thinks that it
is good and to his liking also. Only when there arise anxiety and repentance,
then the weight of the burden caused by defilements becomes apparent. Although
a person may not be aware of his being burdened by these kilesa, all those
passions that are going to defile his mind are the means of burdening him. As
long as that Brahma lives, the groups (khandha) which constitute his existence
produce all kinds of defilements and will burden him throughout his life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>By
way of viparinama at the end means: the phrase 'in the end the being is
burdened by way of viparinama (change)' means the death or dissolution of the
five groups of existence pertaining to that being, and that is his
viparinama-dukkha (suffering due to change). Because there is the dissolution
of that Brahma's body, he will have to be reborn in a lower plane-the sensuous
plane. He may gradually go down till he reaches Avici. He may be reborn as a
dog, a pig, a bird, a mosquito a gadfly, a louse, a bug and so forth. Thus the
five groups of khandha belonging to that Brahma burden him by way of viparinama.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Therefore,
that Brahma's body is known as dukkha-sacca inas much as it has the four
characteristics--pilanattha, sankhatatta, santapattha and viparinamattha. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>II.
The Burden of Dukkha in the Deva World<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the six abodes of devas also, the five groups of existence found in any devas
will firstly burden him by way of sankhata at the beginning, by way of santapa
in the middle, and finally by way of viparinama. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sankhata
dukkha: here the burden by 'sankhata', may be explained as follows: It briefly
means alms-giving, restraint of bodily and verbal actions, and restraint of
mental action. Only when one has performed these wholesome deeds in this
present life will he be able to arise in the deva-plane in his next birth and
attain the body of a deva. He will not be able to achieve such a state by
developing his mental groups only. By giving away his property to others in
charity, a person who has wealth of a hundred kyats or a thousand kyats may be
reduced to poverty in a single day; morality means strict observance and
restraint. If one does not practise alms-giving and morality, he is bound to be
reborn in the lower worlds in his next birth. So it is necessary to perform
these wholesome deeds to reach the deva world. Even when they arise in the
happy course of existence by virtue of their wholesome deeds done in the
previous existences, if they have offered on a small scale in their past
existence, they will have to lead a base life in their present existence. The
more they practiced dana and sila, the better positions they will enjoy in
their present existence. So people have to practice alms-giving spending a lot
of money and also observe precepts with great self-control, because they fear
that they may be low down in lower worlds in their next existence. When they
have to do this merely because it is essential for their future welfare, it is
dukkha. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anything
that is performed compulsorily is dukkha. If, without prac- tising dana and
sila, a being were able to arise in the deva-plane after his death, or if he
were able to arise in the Brahma plane without prac- tising calm, who would
care to perform such wholesome deeds as dana, sila and bhavana.? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Santapa
dukkha: Once the beings obtain the bodies of devas in the deva-planes, great
fire of passion rise up from the body and burn that deva throughout his life,
dosa, moha, soka, parideva, dukkha, domanassa and upayasa, arise in his life in
the fullness of time. This is how a deva is burdened by way of santapa. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Viparinama
dukkha: Again, while the devas are thus enjoying pleasures in the deva-plane,
their span of life expires, and just like a big fire suddenly put out by an
external agency, these devas die suddenly, and generally they arise in the
lower worlds. In fact, their khandha cause them to arise in the lower worlds.
This is how the devas are burdened by way of viparinama finally. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Out
of three ways of burdening at the beginning, in the middle and at the end, the
burden of sankhata is very heavy for Brahmas. Because they are able to bear the
heavy burden of sankhata, the santapa in the middle becomes a little lighter
for them. The burden of viparinama also comes after a long time. Their
life-span is calculated in terms of kappa (world-cycles). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the case of devas in the six deva-worlds, the burden of sankhata is not heavy.
The practice of dana and sila is a thousand times easier than the practice of
jhana and bhavana. As the burden of sankhata is not heavy and as kilesa have
not even faded, the burden of santapa is very heavy when one becomes a deva.
The fire of passion and sensous lust arisen out of the six sense-doors burns
those devas up to the end of their lives. The remaining fire of defilements
also burns when the time is ripe. The burden by way of viparinama also comes
very quickly. Their span of life is calculated in terms of years, months and
days. The life- span of the devas is like the wink of an eye when compared to
that of Brahmas. Though there is said to be pleasures and enjoyments in the
whole of the six deva-worlds, all these are fires of kama and raga that are
burning them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thus
the khandhas of six deva-worlds burden the devas in four ways and as the burden
is manifest it is clearly dukkha-sacca. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>III.
The Burden of Dukkha in the Human World<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the case of men, too, the mental and physical phenomena in their khandha always
burden them in three ways of sankhata, santapa and viparinama. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sankhata
dukkha: As they have not to strive very hard in the field of sankhata, their
burden of santapa is very heavy, and is a hundred thousand times greater than
that of a deva. Their time of destruction too comes to them very quickly. Their
span of life is an infinitesimal fraction of that of a deva. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Santapa
dukkha: How heavily the khandha of men are burdened by way of santapa may be
explained as follows: The trouble of being conceived in the womb of a mother,
the trouble of having to be born, the trouble of feeling warm when residing in
a warm region during the warm weather, the trouble of feeling cold when
residing in a cool region during the cold weather, the trouble of living in the
torrid zone and exposing oneself to the heat of the scorching sun, the blowing
of hot wind and the biting by flies and fleas, the immense trouble to be
undertaken by a cultivator to cultivate his lands amidst those troubles for the
purpose of his livelihood, the trouble of serving under a government, the
trouble of having to transact civic duties, the trouble concerning one's kith,
and kin, the trouble of feeding the so called body morning and evening so that
it may live, the trouble of changing the postures every now and then as one is
not able to remain for long in any one posture during one of the four modes of
deportment, the trouble of supplying nutritive essence to the defilements that
arise at the six sense-doors and which may be compared to ogres and demons.
These are all suffering which are the common ways of the world. There are other
kinds of suffering such as the troubles arising out of the over-enjoyment of
sensuous pleasures, the trouble arising out of earning a livelihood by
performing evil deeds, the trouble of maintaining wife and children, trouble of
becoming a man among people who profess a faith involving wrong views, thus
dragging him to the lower worlds as long as he remains in that clan or nation,
the troubles arising from self- mortification by living near the fire during
the hot season and by remaining in the water during the cold season, etc.,
which are fruitless and are the practices of people of wrong views, the trouble
connected with disease, bruises, wounds and pains, and the immense troubles
caused by extern enemies, such as water, fire, thieves, rulers and those
disliked. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thus
the burdens of santapa for human beings, in the round of samsara are various
and heavy. The body of human beings burdens them in such a manner by way of
santapa. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Viparinama
dukkha: The khandha of men burden them by viparinama. To have become a man is
one of the rare opportunities, and even when a being arises in the world of
men, he is liable to die at any moment from the time of conception in the
mother's womb up to the end of the span of his life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thus
at the embryonic stage immediately formed after conception a being has the
appearance of a little drop of butter-oil scum attached to a fine woollen thread.
Then follows the abbuda (an oval shaped tiny mass), then the pesi (the lump of
flesh), then the ghana (clot), then the pasakha (off-shoots), in which later
stage arms, legs, etc., are forming. In the whole of the round of rebirths, a
being arises and perishes countless times in any one of the above-mentioned
stages of life. Thus khandha of men burden them in the four ways, and so this
is purely dukkha-sacca. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>IV.
The Burden of Dukkha in the Lower Planes<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
khandha of beings in the four lower worlds burden them by four ways. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sankhata
dukkha: Unwholesome volitional actions cause beings to arise in the four lower
worlds. There is the declaration: 'Papasmimramate mano' (The minds of beings
take delight in evil actions). They perform evil actions according to their
wishes and do not consider it as suffering while they can enjoy their lives
according to their inclinations, and so its burden of sankhata consequences may
be said to be not very heavy, but by judging the severity of the resultant
effects, it may be said that its burden of sankhata consequences is very heavy
indeed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Santapa
dukkha: As regards the beings that arise in the four lower worlds, the Buddha
declared that it was not possible to explain in full how these beings are
burdened by santapa, because they are numerous and it would occupy a great deal
of time. They have been discussed generally in the Samvega-Vatthu. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Those
who arise in hell will have their bones, nerves, flesh, hearts, lungs, brains,
etc., all red-hot and tongues of fire will spring out of their skins. Thus they
will remain for hundreds of thousands, billions, trillions, and decillions of
years, experiencing intolerable heat. So long as their resultant effects are
not exhausted they will not be free from such misery. In like manner there are
myriads of beings who are arising in the various lower worlds, and who are
suffering there for decillions and decillions of years. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>(The
Samvega-Vatthu also describes the santapa-dukkhe relating to the petas, ghosts,
asuras (demons) and animals.) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Viparinama
dukkha: In the case of viparinama at the end which is the passing away, one may
arise in an infernal region for a single unwholesome volitional action; and
when resultant effect comes to an end, one may pass away from there due to the
burden of viparinama and be reborn in a lower region which is deeper than that
of one's previous existence. One may not have the opportunity to arise in the
happy higher planes even after thousands of existences. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Here
the explanation given by the Sammohavionodani Commentary may be pointed out.
For beings wandering in samsara the number of existences in which they live up
to the principles of virtue are comparatively few. Most of the existences are
in the lower worlds where beings prey upon one another. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Even if
they happen to be reborn in the world of men for many a time, in one out of a
hundred of such existences would they be able to encounter the Buddha-Dhamma
and practise it. They would hold wrong views or be vicious people in a greater
number of existences. Evil conduct in deeds, words and thought done by any
being in an existence is incalculable. So, among worldly beings existing in the
present life, any one being possesses myriads of evil actions done by him in
the innumerable past existences that could drag him to hell. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Those
beings who are destined to arise in the hells, in the peta world and in the
asura world also possess myriads of old accumulated unwwholesome volitional
actions; and the same is the case with those who arise in the planes of devas and
Brahmas. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If a
being who dies from the world of men, the deva plane or the Brahma plane
happens to be reborn for a time in hell, all the unwholesome kamma done by him
in his past existences will have the opportunity to play their parts. One evil
kamma after another would cause him to be reborn continually in the four lower
worlds and he would not have an opportunity to arise in the happy course of
existence in another one thousand, ten thousand or a hundred thousand
existences. A being bound to be reborn in the lower worlds by having performed
a comparatively small amount of evil action, could arise there continuously for
a great number of aeons due to his successive past kamma. There are decillions
and decillions of such beings who become 'rooted in hell' and who have no
opportunity to arise in the happy course of existence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Here
ends the brief exposition as to how the beings belonging to four lower worlds
are burdened by way of way of santapa and viparinama. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
also explains how the khandha of a being in any one existence is burdened by
sankhata, santapa and viparinama. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
Multitude of Dukkha for Cultivators<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
five groups of existence corporeality group and mental groups of a cultivator
burden him by sankhata, santapa and viparinama every month and every year. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sankhata
dukkha: In cultivating the lands and consuming the yearly crops, firstly the
trouble of tilling the lands, sowing the seeds and looking after the plants
burden the cultivator by way of sankhata. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Santapa
dukkha: The trouble of looking after the standing crop, reaping the harvest,
threshing corn, storing the corn in the granary, guarding the granary,
disposing of the corn thus stored, living on the sale proceeds of the corn,
sustaining such evil actions as lobha, dosa, mana, issa and macchariya--all
these burden the cultivator by santapa. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Viparinama
dukkha: Moreover, he is burdened by viparinama daily when he has to consume his
wealth, thus reducing the amount. Here, one may argue: 'Only the destruction of
property by fire or water should be termed &quot;burden&quot;. The gradual
decrease of wealth owing to expenditure should not be termed a
&quot;burden&quot;. This is an argument advanced by bitterly ignorant persons.
If the crop thus acquired by the cultivator be permanent, i.e. it can never
become less and exhausted, his one year's labour would be sufficient to
maintain him peacefully for the rest of his life. Thus he would be free from
the trouble of tilling the ground again, etc. He would even have an opportunity
to live his whole life spending his time in practising the Buddha-Dhamma and
thereby attaining a great deal of supramundane benefit. As it is, the crop is
not permanent, but impermanent. As the crop becomes less and exhausted due to
daily usages he is reduced to poverty and dire straits. For that reason, when
the next rainy season starts, he has to take the trouble of tilling his land,
cultivating it. In this manner he will have to continue from year to year till
he becomes old and dies at last. Although he has obtained the opportunity of
'becoming a man', which is a rare opportunity, as he has no opportunity to hear
the Buddha-Dhamma and practise it, he misses the chance of reaping supramundane
benefits. There is no way out for those foolish people who are entangled is
such worldly pleasures as these destructible and impermanent things which can
never lead one to the state of permanent happiness. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Wise
people regard all these as 'unsatisfactoriness of life', because one has no
chance to escape from the sphere of suffering; has not found a way out, has to
encounter such suffering in his future births, has no opportunity to practise
the Buddha-Dhamma in this present birth and has to take the trouble of tilling
the soil, etc. To these wise people all are the same, whether one loses his
property by spending for himself or by its being destroyed by fire or water.
Ultimately they regard the sensuous pleasures found in the world of men, the
planes of devas and Brahmas--in the thirty-one planes of existence as
unsatisfactoriness of life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Those
foolish people who have no such kind of understanding would feel sorry if their
properties were destroyed by fire or water, because they could not use them for
themselves, but they would not be sorry if their property lessened owing to
their own expenditure according to their will and pleasure. They would feel
quite satisfied with that. So long as one's heart does not burn at such wastage
and deterioration, one will never have a chance of escaping such suffering.
Only when one's mind is moved at that, will one have a chance to do so. Then
only will one be able to realise the groups of existence found in the world of
men, the deva plane and the Brahma plane as sufferinng, and not otherwise. Only
if a person clearly discerns the various grades of advantages enumerated above,
will he be able to realise as suffering all the days, months, years and world
cycles he has wasted in many of his past existences without reaping any
benefit, just like throwing water into the sand. This is the answer to the
argument. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
above is the exposition how the crops which are produced and exhausted yearly
burden a cultivator in three ways: sankhata, santapa and viparinama. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Relying
on this principle, discriminate and understand how a being is burdened by
various kinds of suffering for days and months continuously. Ponder over the
matter and understand how in this cosmos, earning wealth for one's livelihood
and spending money on food and clothing are burdening in three ways. Extend
this to the cases of men, devas and Brahmas who have enjoyed sensuous pleasures
in their respective planes, by virtue of their having done wholesome volitional
actions in respect of gifts, morality and mental development in wandering in
samsara. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sense
Object and Suffering<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
perceiving objects, when the visible object comes into contact with the
eye-organ, it is pleasurable to the eye. When the visible object is removed,
the sense pleasure to the eye disappears. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
sound comes into contact with the ear-organ, it is pleasurable to the ear. When
the sound, is removed the sense pleasure to the ear disappears. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
same principle holds good in the cases of nose and odour, tongue and taste,
body and tangible object, mental element and mind object-element. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Corresponding
to the six sense-objects, there are six kinds of craving: craving for visible
objects, for sounds, odour, taste bodily-impression, mental impressions; and
also six kinds of feeling: feeling associated with seeing, hearing, smelling,
tasting, bodily-lmpression and mental-impression. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
feed the six kinds of craving, six kinds of sense-objects have to be kept in
readiness. Those who are following these sensuous pleasures cannot get rid of
them. These sense objects are also subject to decay. So feelings such as joy
and mentally agreeable feeling burden the beings in all their existences by
sankhata, santapa and viparinama. They are not able to get out of this pit of
suffering for many existences and world-cycles. Nor are they able to obtain the
opportunity of practising the Dhamma which can lead them to deliverance. They
only deviate from this course and are tempted to follow the previously
mentioned disadvantageous ways. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
above is the exposition as to how beings are continuously burdened by the five groups
of existence at every hour and at every moment. Highly obvious facts have been
sought and set out in the above exposition of viparinama dukkha. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
shall now briefly explain the viparinama dukkha alone. In this samsara,
suffering in the four lower worlds is intense. Those who know of it greatly
dread to fall there. As for those who do not know of it, they have to suffer
there for their ignorance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Unwholesome

ceases, those kamma also cease. For example, in introducing a light into a
room, the flame may be compared to evil kamma. When the fire is strong, the
light becomes bright, and when the fire becomes weak, the light also becomes
dim. When the fire dies out, the light also disappears. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Although
the beings with sakk</span><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Foreign1'>a</span><span

are bound for hell, they may know to some extent the intensity of suffering in
the lower worlds, and they may perform evil actions, simply because they are
tempted by their hellish element. What can be said then of those people who are
either utterly ignorant of this or who maintain false views? Their hellish
element will play its part completely. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>While
wandering in samsara, there are very few existences where a being can
understand what evil actions are and the dangers of the lower worlds. There are
a great number of existences where they do not know about it, or where they
maintain false views. A person in one thousand of his existences might
encounter only one existence where he could differentiate between good and
evil. The explanation given so far is a point to judge how much greater a
being's unwholesome volitional actions would be, though there may be many
wholesome volitional actions done by him in his past existences, and while
wandering in this round of rebirths. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Another
point to consider is how much greater a being's unwholesome volitional actions

worldlings are the actions done by those who dread the dangers of hell, so that
they may escape from such dangers. Even though they arise in the planes of men,

the result of multiplying more evil kamma in whatever existence he may happen
to arise. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
wholesome kamma such as alms-giving, morality and mental development performed
by any one being in his past existences are also subject to change

further effect. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
groups of existence found in men, devas and Brahmas are also subject to decay.
It is the law of cosmic order that they must dissolve at the exhaustion of
their kamma and the expiry of their span of life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
groups of existence of those who are enjoying sensuous pleasures in the planes

reborn in the lower worlds. They then have to sink in the ocean of suffering in
hell which they dread very much. As explained by the commentators previously,
these beings will have no chance to escape the hells and arise in a higher
plane even after a lapse of one thousand or ten thousand existences. Only after
a very great length of time, will some have the opportunity to arise in a
higher plane, the happy course of existence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Some
will only have a chance to escape at the end of the world-system, i.e. when it

the groups of existence by viparinama. As soon as they die in that state their

causes them to be reborn in the lower worlds. They then have to sink in the
ocean of suffering in hell and have no chance to escape in a thousand or ten
thousand existences. The sequences in this respect are the same as mentioned
above. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
above is the textual explanation as to how beings wander in the round of
rebirths. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Here,
men, devas and Brahmas may be compared to victims, and the groups of existence
to the murderers. The law of change may be compared to a very sharp sword. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the Khandha-Vagga of the Samyutta-Nikaya,[4] the Buddha declared: 'Corporeality
is a murderer, so too are vedana, sanna, sankhara and vinnana'. According to
this, it is to be remembered that whenever beings pass away, their respective
khandha play the part of murderers. If we examine the causes of all deaths, we
shall find that there can be no death unless there are dislocation,
displacement or change in the body. If there be no such change, even if
lightning were to strike a person on the head, he would not die. That shows
that the khandha of a being are really murdering him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Another
interpretation: As people call Maccu the god of death which itself is death
personified, the law of change (viparinama) is again termed a murderer. The
inherent quality of the law of change found in men, devas and Brahmas causes
their death, Thus the khandha of men, devas and Brahmas are alway receiving
capital punishment, and therefore are dukkha-dhamma (suffering miserably). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All
human beings who are trying to take refuge in the world of men because they
fear the dangers of hell are killed and caused to arise in the lower worlds
from time to time by the groups of existence and sakk</span><span lang=EN-US

lang=EN-US style='font-family:Foreign1'>tt</span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>hi. The same holds good in the cases of
devas and Brahmas. The khandha of beings that are subject to change are
murderers, and the unwholesome kamma together with soul-belief are constantly
tending to drag them to the lower worlds. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the cases of men, devas and Brahmas who have already got rid of soul-belief,
although they die through the agencies of their khandha, they are never reborn
in the lower planes, but in the higher planes of existence. This matter will be
fully discussed when we come to the Chapter on Magga-Sacca (the Noble Truth of
the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
question may be raised at this point: 'If what has been said be true, there
should be no inhabitants in the planes of men, devas and Brahmas. But that is
not the case. There are plenty of men in the world of men, many devas in the
deva-worlds and many Brahmas in the Brahma-worlds. So, it may be said that it
is an unwarranted threat.' This is the kind of question raised by those
ignorant people who have not the slightest idea of the vastness therein of the
four lower worlds, and the density of population. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
happy course of existence is very extensive, but the inhabitants are very few.
An abode of a deva or a Brahma is as big as live or ten of our townships. Their
bodies are about six gavuta high. Each of the planets we see high above the sky
is of enormous dimensions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
woeful course of existence is also extensive and the inhabitants there are
immensely numerous too. The number of people in the world of men, and the
number of inhabitants in the six deva-worlds and the twenty Brahma-worlds
cannot even be equal to the number of a single kind of insect, say ants, living
in our country of Burma. In our country alone, even besides ants, there are
countless numbers of aquatic and land animals. Just imagine how great would be
the number of those aquatic and land animals residing in the big islands, small
islands, oceans, seas, mountains, rivers and lakes of the world excluding those
of Burma. Thus, if the number of occupants in the twenty-seven planes of the
happy course of existence be compared with those in the animal world, it will
be found to be very insignificant. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Crowded
in Avici Hell<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It is
said in the commentaries as follows: 'There are eight kinds,of hells, each of
which is as big as Jambudipa and is about 1000 yojanas in extent. The lowest of
these eight hells is Maha Avici where the inhabitants are packed to the full
like mustard seeds in a bamboo tube. All those beings who have committed the
evils of the deepest dye usually take rebirth in Avici, the most frightful of
the many hells. If Avici alone is packed so much, just consider how many beings
there will be in the seven other major hells and many other minor hells. Thus,
if compared with the inhabitants of a single hell, the number of inhabitants in
the other twenty-seven planes of the happy course of existence is
insignificant. Extend this to the cases of petas (ghosts) and asuras (demons). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Only
the three kinds of wholesome kamma--alms-giving, morality and mental
development--can cause a being to arise in the happy course of existence, and
only when a being can objectify a wholesome kamma at the moment of death will
he be able to take in the happy course of existence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>On
the other hand, if he objectifies an unwholesome kamma at the moment of death,
he will as a matter of course be reborn in the four lower worlds. A countless
number of acquatic and land animals pass away in one day in Burma alone. Of
these very few would be able to objectify a wholesome kamma at the moment of
death. There will be not even one in a hundred thousand. The same is the case
with all beings in the lower worlds. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>How
can the beings who do not know what is wholesome kamma, objectify such kamma at
the moment of death? A being who is reborn in the four lower worlds usually
takes rebirth there for many existences, and when his old accumulated kamma
wane, the apara-pariya-vedaniya-kamma (kamma ripening in successive births)
comes into play and he has no, chance to arise in the happy course of
existence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Those
who are able to use logic and reason and those who are ignorant think that
there are very many people in this world. By seeing the planets or
constellations high above the sky, they think that there are many inhabitants
in the deva-worlds. They have not the slightest idea as to how difficult it is
to have become a man. They have heard the discourses about the blind turtle and
the yoke[5] and the comparison of the small piece of earth on the fingernail
and the great earth itself,[6] but do not realise their truth. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
shall now expound the four different interpretations of the term
'samudaya-sacca'. 'Samudaya' means 'the cause of ever continuing this
psycho-physical process of existence'. It also means 'the cause of ever
continuing the unsatisfactoriness of life'. There is no more continuing of this
psycho-physical process of existence after the death of an arahat who has
overcome all kinds of craving, and there is no more continuing of suffering in
him. Therefore it should be definitely understood that craving is the origin of
ever continuing the arising of suffering in the lives of all beings, throughout
all of their existence. In the world there is kama-tanha (sensual craving), and
those who overcome this craving are free from sankhata (that produced by a
combination of causes), santapa (burning), viparinama (change) and suffering
connected with the maintenance of their wives and children. Those who strive
for sensual pleasures are burdened by these till their death. Although they have
had the rare opportunity of attaining manhood during the Buddha's Sasana, to
encounter which, also, is another rare opportunity, they have no opportunity to
add to the glory of learning of the doctrine and practice of the Dhamma. As
they have sown this seed of craving, the off-shoots and branches in the nature
of 'desire to accumulate wealth', 'desire to be handsome and good-looking',
'desire to be wealthy', 'desire to compete with others', etc., which are but
the expansion of craving, spring forth endlessly. These expansions of craving
have their relevant suffering with three aspects in each: sankhata, santapa and
viparinama. This is the exposition of the nature of the origin of suffering,
which as we see, arises along with the expansion of craving in its three
aspects. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
are six kinds of craving: rupa-tanha (craving for visible objects), sadda-tanha
(craving for sounds), gandha-tanha (craving for odours) rasa-tanha (craving for
tastes), photthabba-tanha (craving for bodily impressions), dhamma-tanha (craving
for mental impressions). These cravings having four interpretations in each, we
have 24 interpretations in all. Rupa-tanha means craving for pleasant visible
objects. For these objects beings cannot be free from the burden of sankhata,
santapa and viparinama. How? It is in this way: This craving by way of ayuhana
(the fever of unsatisfied longing) forces beings to strive and find ever fresh
delight. They have no desire to get rid of such delightful objects. This
craving is also expanded in the following ways: By way of nidana (foundation;
origin; cause), they incline to have more and more pleasurable objects and
enjoy more and more. They have no contentment of mind. By way of samyoga
(union; association) they desire always to be associated with these pleasant
objects. They have not the slightest idea to part with these pleasurable
objects. By way of palibadha (obstruction; hindrance; impediment), they prevent
beings from parting with these pleasant objects, and also obstruct the sources
of tranquillity of mind. They do not allow beings to attain calmness of mind
obtained by not mingling with these objects. Thus craving for visible objects
causes beings to sustain suffering by functioning in these four ways. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
same holds good for craving for sounds, etc. Dhamma-tanha means craving for
vedana-kkhandha (feeling group), sanna-kkhandha (perception group),
sankhara-kkhandha (group of mental formations) and vinnana-kkhandha
(consciousness group) found in a person's life or in the lives of his dear
ones. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Another
way of expression: There are also three kinds of craving. They are kama-tanha,
bhava-tanha, and vibhava-tanha. Kamatanha means craving for sensuous objects,
as form, etc. Bhava-tanha means 'having delight in the jhana attained by
oneself'. Vibhava-tanha means 'having delight in wrong view of
self-annihilation (uccheda-ditthi)'. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Meals
prepared from coarse cereals, such as maize, etc., are very plain. They are not
palatable and not very easy to swallow. When we add ghee, butter, fish soup or
beef soup to it and when we eat it with pork or chicken, then only can we eat
tastefully. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the same manner, the consciousness of beings of the sensuous planes, having
been incessantly mixed with such 'burning' things as sensuous lust, ill-will,
etc., are very and and hot. When they have no opportunity to come in contact
with external objects, they at once become monotonous, drowsy and devoid of
interest. just as a dog becomes irritable and restless when an ulcer in its
body is eaten by maggots, these cravings also cannot rest for a moment, and
have to run immediately after an external object, or after one of their
associates. Only when these cravings are constantly associated with external
objects can the agreeableness of consciousness of beings become conspicuous.
The more attractive are the external objects, the better will be the state of
agreeableness of beings. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thus,
beings experience sensuous pleasures in association with external objects and
enjoy the status of Sakka, the king of devas, worldly kings, wealthy persons,
devis, women, etc., in the sensuous planes. When they are kept away from these
external objects, they become drowsy and bored. Then the craving, which may
here be compared to a burning fire, arises and longs for external objects. To
satiate its hunger, it has to be fed. So, in accumulating the combustible
substances for this burning craving, we find that myriads of evil actions and
myriads of sufferings accompany the lives of these beings. This craving is
called sensuous craving. This sensuous craving always murders beings, by
sinking them in the ocean of suffering, while the beings of this sensuous
sphere are striving hard for the maintenance of their wives and children and
also to earn a livelihood. Just as water that runs down the steep hills into
the river and carries all dry twigs, branches and leaves down to the ocean,
this never-satiated craving carries to the four lower worlds all those
worldlings and men of the sensuous sphere, who are not living according to the
Buddha-Dhamma. This is the expositionon sensuous craving of the origin of
suffering. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Those
wise people who understand the work of this burning craving treat this sensuous
sphere on the same level as the four lower worlds, discard their properties,
become samanas and practise calm in the forest so that they may be free from
such suffering. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
meal that is cooked on the jotipasana (a burning glass made of crystal) used by
the northern islanders is very delicious and palatable. It is comparable to
those delicious dishes of ghee, butter, pork and chicken found in our country,
and if our dishes happen to be mixed with that meal, the latter would lose its
taste and delicacy altogether. Thus the union of the two will have to be much
feared. Similarly, one attains jhana which is free from such hindrances as
sensuality and ill-will. Detached from sensual objects, detached from
unwholesome states of mind, he enters into the first jhana, which is
accompanied by thought-conception and discursive thinking is born of detachment
and filled with rapture. External objects are obstacles to him. The craving for
such jhana, or the arising in the Brahma plane in the next birth by virtue of
such jhana, is called bhava-tanha. Understand the origin of suffering in
relation to the bhava-tanha in the same way as has been explained in the
previous chapter where the suffering in the cases of constituent groups of
existence contained in Brahmas has been expounded. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
exposition of the origin of suffering in relation to the vibhavatanha which is
associated with miccha-ditthi (wrong belief) is not given here, as it is not
necessary to be explained in the Buddha's Sasana. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

been explained before there are four interpretations of magga-sacca. They are: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>niyyanatho
(release; deliverance) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>adhipateyyatho
(sovereignty; power). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Of
these, I shall expound how sotapannas are able to attain and enjoy the
niyyanatho aspect of The Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering. When a
person attains sotapattimagga (the path of stream- winning), miccha-ditthi
(wrong understanding) and vicikiccha (sceptical doubt) that accompany him come
to an end. All his accumulated old unwholesome kamma and those unwholesome
actions that have been performed by him in the present life and are to take
effect in successive births or future births become ineffective. He is thus
free from falling to apaya-samsara (rebirth in the lower worlds) for ever. At
most he will have to wander in the happy course of existence, such as the world
of men, deva-planes and Brahma planes. Even in those planes, never would he
arise as one who commits evil actions and who leads a bad mode of living; nor
would he arise as one who is deprived of power, wealth and glory, He would only
arise as one who is endowed with wisdom, glory, wealth and power. It is the law
of cosmic order that such a being would never be reborn in a plane lower than
he has arisen in, after his passing away from the present plane. If he so
desires, he can take rebirth in the same old plane, or he can arise in a higher
plane. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
this manner he wanders in the happy course of existence for many a world-cycle.
Although sotapannas wander in the happy course of existence, unlike the
ordinary worldlings they do not drift along the current of samsara and are not
destined to take rebirth in the lower worlds. From the moment they attain the
Path of stream-winning, they are delivered from such evils as sakk</span><span

(personality-belief), vicikiccha, ducarita-durajiva (evil actions and bad livelihood),
and apaya-dukkha, and have thus attained sa-upadisesa-nibbana[7] (the full
extinction of defilements with the groups of existence still remaining). They
then wander in the happy course of existence as ariyas (noble ones) who belong
to the supramundane sphere. After wandering in the planes of human beings,
devas and Brahmas, when they do not desire to wander any more in the happy
course of existence, they attain anupadisesa-nibbana (the full extinction of
defilements without the groups remaining, or the 'no-more-continuing' of this
psycho-physical process of existence). This is the exposition as to how
sotapannas gradually rise till they attain anupadisesa-nibbdna. This is the
definition of niyyanatho. The above shows the exposition of the aspect of
niyyanatho attained and enjoyed by sotapannas. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Below
is the explanation of the aspect of hetuttho (having the characteristic of
being a cause for the attainment of arahatship) attained and enjoyed by
sotapannas. From the moment the sotapannas attain the Path of stream-winning,
the inherent qualities of the holy ones ever exist in them, and they become
stronger and stronger in succeeding existences. The qualities of morality
established by them become greater and greater. So too are the powers of their samadhi
(concentration of mind) and panna (wisdom). So also are the powers of
satipatthana-dhamma (four applications of mindfulness), sammappadh</span><span

dhamma (right exertion), iddhi-pada-dhamma (roads to power), indriya- dhamma
(faculties), bala-dhamma (powers), bojjhanga (the seven links of enlightenment)
and magganga-dhamma (the Noble Eightfold Path). The development of such powers
in one existence after another is known as hetuttho. The above is the
exposition of the aspect of hetuttho (suitability for the attainment of
arahatship) attained and enjoyed by sotapannas. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now
comes the aspect of dassanatho (realization of the truth) attained and enjoyed
by sotapannas. From the moment the sotapannas attain the Path of stream-winning
up to the time of their attaining anupadisesa-nibbana, while they are wandering
in the happy course of existence, they have no perplexity of mind in regard to
the existence of The Four Noble Truths--The Noble Truth of Suffering, The Noble
Truth of the Origin of Suffering, The Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering
and The Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering. Whenever
they contemplate these Four Noble Truths, they at once realize them vividly,
just as one can distinctly see the planets and constellations high above in the
sky. This is the exposition of the aspect of dassanatho (realization of the
truth) attained and enjoyed by sotapannas. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Below
is the explanation of the aspect of adhipateyyatho (mastery over oneself)
attained and enjoyed by sotapannas. The wholesome volitional actions, such as
dana (alms-giving), sila (morality) and bhavana (mental development) performed
by these sotapannas are free from the operation of craving. Thus they are free
from the 'accumulation of merit' called punnabhisankhara. They have attained
the highest amongst all the mundane wholesome kamma. Their minds become as pure
as a highly polished conch. These all help them to attain anupadisesa-nibbana. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
is the exposition of the aspect of adhipateyyatho attained and enjoyed by sotapannas.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now I
shall expound the four aspects of nirodha-sacca (The Noble Truth of the
Cessation of Suffering), which itself is called Nibbana. There are four aspects
of nirodha-sacca. They are: nissaranattho (having the characteristic of being an
escape), pavivekattho (having the characteristic of being free from
disturbance), amatattho (a state where there is no more death or dissolution),
and asankhatatho (having the characteristic of the unoriginated, Nibbana). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
supramundane sphere of such sotapannas as Visakha, Anathapindika, and
decillions of holy ones in the deva-countries of catu-maharajika, etc., may be
compared to the great Sita ocean situated at the foot of Mount Meru. Decillions
and decillions of such noble ones may be compared to decillions and decillions
of fishes living in that great ocean. In what respect do they resemble them ?
It is in this manner that great Sita ocean situated amidst the Yuganda
mountains is very wide and immensely deep. The water in that great ocean never gets
diminished, nor is its water evaporated by any of the sun. The water is so
clean that even a peacock's feather or fine cotton will sink to the bottom of
the ocean. In the same manner it is the law of cosmic order that this
sa-upadisesa-nibbana, the supramundane sphere of ariyas, such as Visakha,
Anathapindika, etc., will never be diminished owing to the lapse of time, even
after a lapse of many millions of world-cycles. The state of 'the full
extinction of defilements with the groups of existence still remaining' will
never be diminished. The state of Nibbana never becomes extinct. It is also the
law of cosmic order that these sotapannas are never entangled with evil
actions, sceptical doubt and bad livelihood, because the state of
sa-upadisesa-nibbana exists in them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Just
as the great fishes in that great Sita ocean need not fear the water in the
ocean getting diminished, these sotapannas need never fear losing their
attainment of 'the full extinction of defilements with the groups of existence
still remaining'. Just as the water of that great ocean is not warmed by the
rays of the sun, these sotspannas who have attained Sa-upadisesa-nibbana will
not be polluted with any defilement or threatened with the dangers of wandering
in samsara, however long they may have to wander in the happy course of
existence, and they need not fear that personality-belief will accompany them
anymore. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Just
as the fishes in the great ocean need not be anxious about the water of the
ocean getting warm at any time, these sotapannas also need not be anxious about
the defilements which they have already dispelled by means of the Path and
Frution of the stream-winning. Just as the fishes in the great ocean need not
be anxious about the water of the ocean getting dirty, so also the sotapannas
need not be anxious about their state being polluted with wrong views,
sceptical doubt, evil actions, bad livelihood and hellish qualities. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Just
as the great fishes in that great ocean need not be anxious for a change of
residence to other lakes, rivers and seas, nor be anxious about the ocean water
becoming warm or turbid, these countless numbers of ariyas, who pass amongst
heavenly and human beings at the most for seven times in the round of rebirths,
need not wait till the arising of another Buddha. Retaining the state of
sa-upadisesa-nibbana, they wander in the round of rebirths as wealthy men,
devas and Brahmas and finally attain an-upadisesa-nibbana. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
this juncture one may ask the following question in connection with the
expression 'these sotapannas remain within the supramundane sphere of
sa-upadisesa-nibbana': 'As sotapannas they are able to dispel some of the
defilements only, and at the same time are not free from the sufferings of
rebirth, old age and death, so it cannot be claimed that they have attained
Nibbana, nor are they within the sphere of Nibbana.' The answer to it as
follws: 'Did not the Omniscient Buddha declare that the Nibbana attained by
these sotapannas is specially termed sa-upadisesa-nibbana, because they have
not dispelled all defilements? Is it not that it is declared as
sa-upadisesa-nibbana because these sotapannas will have to take rebirth for at
most seven times, experiencing old age and death for many world-periods to
come?' <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
kind of question is raised by one who does not realise the greatness and
magnificence of Nibbana. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>These
sotapannas, after passing amongst heavenly and human beings for a great length
of time, finally become arahats, and the Nibbana they are then to attain after
getting rid of the groups of existence is called anupadisesa-nibbana. This
Nibbana is not within the scope of sotapannas, and so in expounding the Nibbana
attained by sotapannas, anupadi-sesa-nibbana is not meant thereby, and
therefore not discussed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
nissaranattho (having the characteristic of being an escape) aspect attained
and enjoyed by sotapannas means the following: kilesa- vatta (escape from the
circle of the most evil defilements headed by 'wrong views' and 'sceptical
doubt'), kamma-vatta (escape from the circle of unwholesome kamma such as the
ten kinds of evil conduct in deeds, words, and thought, and also the bad mode
of living), and vipakavatta (escape from the circle of being reborn in the four
lower worlds). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
regards worldlings, although they wander in the round of rebirths as kings of
men, kings of devas or kings of brahmas, as they have not yet attained the
state of escape from the round of rebirths, they have to wander in it,
entangling with wrong views, sceptical doubt, evil conduct and bad livelihood,
which would cause them to arise in the four lower worlds. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Here
ends the exposition of nissaranattho. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Pavivekattha
(retirement; seclusion; solitude): Although sotapannas may wander in the happy
course of existence for many world-cycles, their minds will be ever free from
being molested by wrong views, evil actions and bad livelihood, and suffering
in the four lower worlds. The state of ever being free from the operation of
these evil actions and the evils of the four lower worlds, which are the most
evil things in the round of rebirths, is called retirement, seclusion or
solitude attained and enjoyed by sotapannas. Worldlings are not free from the
operation of such evils. Although they wander in the round of rebirths as kings
of men, devas and brahmas, their minds are at times brightened with right
views, faith, good actions and sense pleasures, and at times darkened with
wrong views, sceptical doubt, evil actions and miseries of the four lower
worlds. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Asankhatattha:
Below is the exposition of asanknatattha (having the characteristic of the
'unoriginated' Nibbana). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
sa-upadisesa-nibbana attained by sotapannas is never destroyed and so it is
eternal. That being the case, it is free from the trouble of setting it up anew.
There is no more trouble of diving into the pit of suffering again to perform
alms-giving in the endeavour to attain Nibbana. There is no more suffering for
them to practise morality and also to lead the life of a samana. The state of
the unoriginated, uncreated, is called the asankhatattha aspect attained and
enjoyed by sotapannas. They, however, practise alms-giving, morality and mental
development for the purpose of further dispelling some defilements that lie
latent in them. They need not worry about personality-belief, sceptical doubt
and the ten kinds of evil actions which have already been extinguished. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Here
ends the exposition of asankhatattha. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Amatattha
(a state where there is no more death or dissolution.) The state of the
extinction of defilements with the groups of existence still remaining, never
gets spoiled, destroyed or deteriorated in the world-cycles to come. For
instance, in the cases of sotapannas like Visakha, Anathapindika and others who
pass from the planes where they are to higher ones, the state never fades away
nor disappears, though their constituent groups of existence which are subject
to change may be destroyed, taking the form of new groups of existence. Nibbana
is 'deathlessness', but the khandha (groups of existence) are mortal and
subject to change. One khandha may go away and another khandha may come, but
the state of sa-upadisesa-nibbana will go on, and so it finally merges into
an-upadisesa-nibbana. Although these sotapannas may wander in the round of
rebirths for many a world-cycle to come, they need not fear the loss of the
cessation of suffering which they have experienced and realised. From the
moment they attain the path of stream-winning up to the time they attain full
Nibbana or anupadisesa- nibbana, this state of sa-upadisesa-nibbana remains as
the refuge and dependence of the countless number of sotapannas. This state is
termed the amatattha (a state where there is no more death or dissolution)
attained and enjoyed by sotapannas. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Suffering and the Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of
Suffering. Moreover, the four aspects of the Noble Truth of Suffering are
included in the three characteristics of existence--characteristic of
impermanence, suffering and selflessness. These four aspects are also within
the orbit of the characteristic of suffering. Of the four interpretations of the
Noble Truth of Suffering, viparinamattha (change) is itself characteristic of
impermanence. If these four aspects of the Noble Truth of Suffering fall within
the province of the characteristics of impermanence and suffering, they will
also be in the orbit of the characteristic of impersonality. So, when one fully
comprehends the three characteristics of impermanence, suffering and
selflessness, he also fully comprehends the sixteen aspects of The Four Noble
Truths, as has been explained before. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>(When
one fully comprehends any one of the three characteristics of existence, he
also automatically comprehends and realises the remaining two characteristics.
The Omniscient Buddha declared. 'O Meghiya, if one realises one of the three
characteristics of existence, he automatically realises the remaining two.') <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Of
the three characteristics, the characteristic of impermanence is the
fundamental one. The whole affair of the characteristic of impermanence is
nothing but marana (death), which means the continually repeated dissolution
and vanishing of all physical and mental phenomena and that these phenomena do
not last even for the time occupied by a wink of the eye, he automatically
fully comprehends and realises the characteristics of suffering and
selflessness. How? It may be explained as follows: If one realises all physical
and mental phenomena in his body continually and repeatedly dissolve and vanish
at every consciousness-moment, will he have any attachment for his body and
take that as pleasure? Or will he also take it that this body is soul-essence? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
above shows that of the three characteristics of existence, the characterstic
of impermanence is the most essential. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
one realises the functioning of the characteristic of impermanence in
corporeality out of the five constituent groups of existence, he is able to attain
the Path of anagami (never-returner). On the other hand, if he realises the
functioning of the four mental formations out of the mental group, he is able
to attain the Path and the Fruition of arahatta (holiness). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>(These
two theories have fully been discussed with Pali and its definition in the
Manual of Ahara Dipani.) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Therefore,
those worldlings who desire to be delivered from the tangle of wrong views,
evil actions, and the state of the worldlings who wander in the round of
rebirths and enjoy the status of those sotapannas like Visakha, Anathapindika
and others, who have attained sa-upadisesa- nibbana and become the inhabitants
of the supramundane sphere, passing through the planes of heavenly and human
beings until they attain the state of anupadisesa-nibbana and fully
comprehending the four aspects of the Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the
Cessation of Suffering and the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering,
should get instructions from a competent teacher on the full interpretations and
aspects of the characteristic of impermanence, and having studied them
conscientiously, should practise vipassana-bhavana through the medium of the
characteristic of impermanence, just as a person whose hair is burning with a
celestial fire or whose head is pierced with a sharp spear desires to quell
this celestial fire of personality-belief or take out the spear of
personality-belief from his head. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Here
the concise Catusacca-Dipani, or the Manual of the Four Noble Truths, comes to
a close. It was written at the Letpandaung Hill, Monywa, at the request of
Pleaders Maung Kyaw and Maung San Lin, for the benefit of those who desire to
know the sixteen interpretations of the Four Noble Truths and who desire to
honour the teaching of the Buddha. It was finished during the Vassa of 1265
Burmese Era (July 1903 C.E.). <o:p></o:p></span></p>
