satta kammassaka: There exist such properties as elephants, horses, vehicles,
cattle, fields, buildings, gold, silver, jewels, etc. Those properties can be
said to belong to us in the present existence before we pass away. But when we
pass away those properties do not accompany us beyond death. They are like
properties which we borrow for some time for our use. They are liable to
destruction during the present existence. As those properties which beings
possess do not accompany them to their new existences, they cannot be claimed
as properties belonging to those beings. The Buddha therefore said, 'sabbe
satta kammassaka.' The only property of all beings that accompanies them is
their own volitional action. Only the mental, verbal and physical volitional
actions of beings always accompany them in this as well as in future
existences. They are not liable to destruction by fire, water, thieves,

three kamma in the Buddhist teachings. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Kinds of Kamma for Future Existences <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
types of kamma performed in this present existence, physical, verbal and
mental, with a view to ripening in future existences, are also divided into two
kinds: three good kamma (having result in future existences), and three bad
kamma (having result in future existences). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All
kinds of physical, verbal and mental kamma that are free from the ten kinds of
immoral conduct and comprise alms-giving, fast-day observance, conduct,
practising meditation, taking refuge in and paying respects to the Three Gems (Buddha,
Dhamma and Sangha), are known as good kamma done in this present life with a
view to ripening in future existences, to being reborn in a good abode. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
any one of the ten kinds of immoral conduct be performed, whether for ripening
in this existence or in the future, that kamma leads one to the lower planes in
future existences. So it is known as bad kamma having its result ripening in
future existence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
this way one should differentiate the good and bad kamma and contemplate all
the three kinds of kamma which are performed everywhere, on land, in water, and
in the sky. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Having
seen with our eyes the three kamma which are performed in this world, we can
also comprehend that all beings, on land, in water and in the sky, have been
performing these three kamma in their past existences of endless world-cycles
and will also perform them in the future. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Like
this universe there are in the four directions, infinite universes in which all
beings in water, and land and in the sky are performing these three kamma. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Having
discerned all these, it is quite apparent that all beings live by these three
kamma done by themselves. They enjoy happiness by virtue of these three kamma.
By performing the three good kamma they enjoy various beneficial results and by
performing the three bad kamma they encounter various kinds of misery and
suffering. The three kamma are their own property which can never be destroyed
by fire, water, thieves, robbers and so forth. Though one may own nothing, not
even a single coin, he can achieve happiness if he has mental kamma in the form
of knowledge and wisdom. So, the Buddha declared 'sabbe satta kammassaka.' All
beings have the three volitional kamma as their own property. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Result of Present Kamma<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Those
who wish to acquire worldly gains, such as wealth, governmental standing and
honour in this life, can achieve their wish if they exert themselves to acquire
education and knowledge, If it be that such worldly gains can be had without
acquiring education and knowledge and by merely worshipping God, the believers
in God may not perform physical, verbal and mental kamma such as trading,
farming, learning arts and sciences. Instead, they may perform only the act of
worshipping God. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As a
matter of fact, it is not so. Like the Buddhists, the Christians, Mohammedans,
etc., are performing the three kinds of kamma, and for this reason they acquire
worldly gains. It is not God but the three kinds of kamma that give these to
them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Result of Past Kamma<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Just
as we can see with our eyes that in this life the worldly gains are not given
by God but are acquired by one's own kamma, similarly we can realise that
beneficial results of being reborn in a wealthy family or in the deva world are
not by virtue of worshipping God but by virtue of past kamma such as
alms-giving, observance of morality and so forth, performed in previous
existences. One who is reborn in a wealthy family becomes the owner of the
riches of that family. That is, all his possessions are due to his past kamma.
Here, the analogy of vegetation should be given. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
process of the formation and growth of vegetation is commonly ascribed to the
seed. According to the Abhidhamma, the element of kinetic energy (tejo) which
is known as caloricity (utu) is said to be the cause. The seed is nothing but
the element of kinetic energy. That element of kinetic energy is the real seed.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
the beginning of the world, before the existence of seeds, vegetation grew from
tejo. Later that vegetation produced fruits and seeds from which trees grew successively.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the same way all beings have kamma as their seeds of becoming: wholesome kamma
as alms-giving, morality, etc; and unwholesome kamma as taking others' lives,
etc. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
process of becoming as men and animals is due to the past kamma in previous
existences. On account of the wholesome kamma, etc., they are reborn as men and
devas, and because of the unwholesome volitional kamma they are reborn in four
lower worlds: hell, animal world, peta world, and asuraka world. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Previous
vegetation produces seeds from which fresh vegetation rises. Thus seeds from
the tree and trees from the seeds appear successively: a cycle of seeds and
trees. Similarly, beings have seeds of kamma in their previous existences. From
these seeds of kamma new existences appear. Thus beings perform kamma which in
turn gives rise to new becomings successively. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Trees
have physical phenomena only. A tree yields many fruits from which many trees
are grown. In the case of beings, they have two kinds of phenomena: physical
and mental phenomena. Of these two, the mental factor is the chief. One mental
factor can produce not more than one new mental factor (i.e. the
patisandhivinnana rebirth consciousness). Therefore, although beings have many
seeds of wholesome and unwholesome kamma in one existence, one mental factor of
the previous existence, i.e. volition (cetana) produces in the next existence
only one mental factor. Since many new mental factors are not produced, one
corporeality-group of the past existence gives rise to not more than one
corporeality-group in the next becoming. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Earth,
water, sun, moon, stars, and so forth, come into existence from the seeds of
kinetic energy which go under the name of caloricity. It is not that they were
created by God. Beings such as men, animals, etc., come into new successive
existences because of the seeds of their past kamma performed in previous
world-cycles of existences. Such view is known as Right View (samma-ditthi). To
hold that God creates them is wrong view (miccha-ditthi). It is the wrong view
of those who, not knowing fully the operative power of kamma and utu, imagine
that they were created by God. Thus with a view to making people abandon wrong
view, and rely upon kamma, knowledge and wisdom, the Buddha said, 'sabbe satta
kammassaka'. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now
there are such things as legacies and heirs. These legacies can be called our
property only before we die; but when we pass away we have to leave them
behind. They do not accompany us to the next existence. They are also liable to
be destroyed by fire, water, thieves and robbers before our death, or they may
be exhausted by us. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
for the three kinds of kamma performed by beings, they are alwavs theirs in
their future existences. They are never destroyed bv fire, etc. For this
reason, kamma is said to be the only property inherited by beings. Beings are
sure to reap the results of their own kamma in future existences. The wholesome
kamma performed by feeding dogs, pigs, fowls and birds can result in a hundred
happy existences. The wholesome kamma performed by feeding virtuous monks can
give rise to a countless number of happy existences as man and deva. Giving
alms worth about a quarter of a kyat in this present life can yield beneficial
results worth more than a thousand kyats in future existences. If a person
kills an animal, such as a fish, fowl or pig, he may be killed in more than a
thousand future existences. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
this world, if a tiny banyan seed is planted, a big banyan tree will grow up
bearing innumerable fruits in more than a thousand years. Similarly, if a mango
seed or a jack-fruit seed is planted, big mango trees and big jack-fruit trees
will grow and bear more than a hundred thousand fruits for many years. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thus
in the case of trees, a small seed is able to yield more than hundred thousand
fruits, leaves, branches and twigs. Similarly, a seed of wholesome kamma such
as alms-giving, morality, meditation, practised at one time, can yield more
than a hundred thousand good results successive future existences. A seed of
unwholesome kamma by killing a being can yield evil and painful results in
numerous following existences. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Such
banyan seeds, mango seeds and jack-fruit seeds may be compared to the seed of
physical, verbal and menal actions. A small seed from which arise numerous
leaves, fruits, branches and twigs may be compared to a seed of kamma that
produces many effects in the following successive existences. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If a
person performs one kamma, the effects always accompany him in many existences
yielding good or bad results at the opportune moments. One can never get rid of
that kamma, but he has to enjoy or suffer its results under appropriate
circumstances. So the Buddha declares, 'sabbe satta kammadayada'. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sabbe
Satta Kammayoni <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
are several causes for the growth of a banyan tree: the banyan seed, the earth,
and the water. Of these causes, the banyan seed is the primary cause; the earth
and water are the secondary causes. In the same way, in getting wages by
working as a labourer, the present kamma, i.e working as a labourer, is the
primary cause. The place for working, the spade, the basket and the employers
who pay wages are the secondary causes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
wholesome past kamma, i.e. alms-giving, morality, etc., which causes one to be
reborn as a human being, and the unwholesome kamma by taking others lives,
etc., which cause one to be reborn as an animal are the primary causes similar
to the banyan seeds. The parents are the secondary causes, just as the earth
and water are for the growth of a banyan tree. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the same way, with regard to the present good and evil results, one's own kamma
performed in the present existence with wisdom and knowledge or otherwise is
the primary cause. So also, one's own wholesome kamma as alms-giving, morality,
etc., and unwholesome kamma as killing beings, performed in previous
existences, are the primary causes of good and evil results. The parents are
not the primary causes, nor is it anything to do with God, For this reason, the
Buddha said, 'sabbe satta kammayoni.' <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now,
there are parents, brothers, sons, relatives, teachers and friends whom we love
and rely upon, but they can be loved and relied upon only for a short period,
i.e. before our death. However, one's own physical, verbal and mental kamma are
constant companions which accompany one and give happiness and prosperity to
one in future existences. So the wholesome kamma alone is one's real relative
or friend which should be esteemed and relied upon. Therefore, the Buddha declares,
'sabbe satta kammabandhu.' <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sabbe
Satta Kammappatisarana<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
this phrase, 'refuge' means reliance upon or taking shelter for protection
against troubles and dangers. In the world those who wish to enjoy, long life
have to rely upon food and drink. Food and drink protect persons from the
danger of starvation. The danger of starvation cannot befall those who have
sufficient food and drink. Similarly it is necessary to rely upon doctors and
medicine for protection against ailments and diseases, and to rely upon weapons
for protection against enemies. In the same way, all kinds of refuge are
resorted to for different purposes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Refuge'
does not mean only worshipping. It also has the meaning of reliance upon and
taking shelter or protection, as mentioned above. We take refuge in the Buddha,
Dhamma, Sangha, teachers and those who are nobler than us by paying homage to
them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
this life a man without property will soon get into trouble. Fearing that
trouble, we have to rely upon kamma by doing such work as will give us money
and property. Lack of wholesome kamma will lead to the lower worlds where one
has to suffer greviously. Fearing such suffering, one has to perform wholesome
kamma which can lead one to be reborn as a man or deva in the existences to come.
The present kamma of working with knowledge and wisdom can save us from danger
in the present life, and wholesome kamma such as alms-giving and moraliy can
save one from the lower worlds in future existences. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
have to rely, on the present kamma of working for avoiding dangers in this
present existence. We have to rely on wholesome kamma also for avoiding
suffering in the lower worlds in future existences. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Buddha, therefore, preaches 'sabbe satta kammappatisarana.' <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Herein
we should analyse several kinds of refuge. In Buddhism there are four kinds of
taking refuge for the future: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>taking
refuge in the Buddha <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>taking
refuge in the Dhamma <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>taking
refuge in the Sangha <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>taking
refuge in one's own wholesome kamma. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>For
example, there are in this world four kinds of refuge for sick persons: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>refuge
in a chief doctor <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>refuge
in good medicine <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>refuge
in assistant doctors <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>refuge
in following their directions with faith. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Of
the above-mentioned four refuges, the chief doctors and the assistants are the
refuge of the patient as they are capable of prescribing good and suitable
medicines for particular diseases. The medicine is the refuge of the patient in
that it can cure him of his disease. The patient's sensible action in following
the directions are also his refuge, as without such actiom on his part the
other three refuges would be ineffective for the cure of the disease. So all
four are the real refuges of the patient. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Those
who commit evil deeds and indulge in sensual pleasures resemble sick persons;
the Buddha resembles the chief doctor who is expert in curing diseases; the
monks resemble the assistant doctor; and the Dhamma resembles the medicine. The
physical, verbal and mental wholesome kamma resemble the sensible action of the
patient in following the directions. In this way there are four kinds of refuge
in Buddhism. The three refuges of the above four: Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha
exist only during the Buddha S</span><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Foreign1'>a</span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>san</span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Foreign1'>a</span><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>.
They do not exist outside it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
refuge of wholesome kamma exists both within and outside the Buddha S</span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Foreign1'>a</span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>san</span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Foreign1'>a</span><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>.
We can never be free from kamma which is operating all the time in this
universe as well as in other innumerable universes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
discourse of 'sabbe satta kammassaka' is also applicable to all the universes
both within and outside the Buddha S</span><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:

lang=EN-US style='font-family:Foreign1'>a</span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>. It is for this reason that the refuge
of kamma alone and not the three refuges of the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha is
dealt with in this discourse. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>These
are the four kinds of refuges to rely upon with a view to acting wisely in this
existence and being reborn in happy existences. Saranam, usually translated
'refuge', means that which can save, give support or protection. Thus food and
drink are the support of beings for long life. Medicines and diet are the
support for the cure of diseases. Kings or rulers are protection against the
danger of dacoits and robbers. Buildings are the refuge for living comfortably
and safely. Boats and steamers are for sea and riverine voyages. The earth is
for support. Similarly water, fire and air are the supports for respective
purposes. In this way there are numerous refuges in this existence. This is the
exposition about the different kinds of refuge in Buddhism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
other religions only one refuge, the refuge of God, is known. So whatever comes
into existence or is destroyed is attributed to God. I shall make this more
clear. In other religions, such as Christianity and Mohammedanism, the true
meaning of refuge is not understood and the respective followers regard God as
their only refuge. Since they believe only in one refuge, they take it for
granted that the appearance and disappearance of the world and of beings are
due to the power of God. They believe that God saves those who have faith in
him by his supernormal power. With this power he can wash away all sins and
evils of beings and give them eternal happiness and eternal life after death.
The good and evil results of beings depend on the will of God. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
disbelieve in kamma thinking that kamma is not the cause of such results. It is
most surprising that those who are really performing kamma entirely disregard
their own acts. Kamma means physical, verbal and mental actions of practising
the teachings of a particular religion. The auspicious act of baptism,
worshipping and praying to God daily, obeying his commandments, etc., are
really kamma. These people believe that God saves only those who perform such
deeds but not those who do not do so; but they do not realise that such deeds
are really 'kamma'. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In those
religions also, as in Buddhism, there are four kinds of refuge. In Buddhism
they are the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha and kamma. But in those religions
they are: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>refuge
in God <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
commandments of God <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>prophets,
such as Christ and Mohammed, and priests <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>their
own kamma in the performance of their religious rites and duties. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
priests and missionaries of those religions do not realise that in their
religions also there are several kinds of refuge. So they regard God as their
only refuge and disregard their kamma. Consequently they believe that the good
and evil, prosperity and ruin, happiness and suffering of all beings are
created only by God and are not due to any other cause. They do not know that
there are various and different causes for these. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
this world, is it simply by worshipping and praying to God that the poor who
desire wealth can get it, or would they get it by the present kamma of working
diligently as a labourer, farmer, trader, etc.? The answer is: wealth is not
usually obtained by worshipping and praying to God. On the other hand,
acquisition of property by performing the present kamma is quite evident in
this world. Therefore, it is believeable that acquiring property in this life
is due to the present kamma and has nothing to do with God. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>God
has no power to give property to anyone. Only the present kamma can do so. If
God had such power to give wealth, his faithful followers would have no
occasion to perform present kamma, they would be enjoying riches given by him;
and those who are not his followers would not get any property although they
were diligently performing the present kamma. But it is not so. The devout
followers of God have to perform the present kamma in order to acquire wealth
and property; and those who are not his followers also can acquire it, if they
desire, by performing the present kamma. For this reason, the acquisition of
wealth in this life is the result of the present kamma. It is not the gift of
God. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Similarly,
if one desires education and knowledge, one can get it by performing the
present kamma of studying and learning. They cannot, as a rule, be acquired by
worshipping God. If one wishes to be a government officer, one will have to
study government rules and regulations. Government posts cannot, as a rule, be
obtained by worshipping and praying to God. Thus we can see with our eyes that
all the worldly gains are obtainable only by the power of the present kamma and
not by the power of God. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
believers in God believe that by worshipping God faithfully they are freed from
all their sins and evils. However, as a rule the sick are not cured by taking
refuge in God only. On the other hand we have seen with our own eyes that the
present kamma of medicine and diet has cured them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
a surprising thing it is to hold that they would be freed from the result of
their sins in the next existence by worshipping God while even a disease such
as ringworm, is not usually cured by praying to God in this life. Again, since
even trifling wealth cannot as a rule be acquired by merely praying to God in
this life, it is also surprising that they believe they would by praying to God
go after death to heaven, where they can enjoy a life of eternal happiness. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now,
having seen with our own eyes that wealth and happiness that have not
previously been attained in this life are achieved by virtue of present kamma
and not by favour of God, we can fully believe that there is no other refuge
than the present kamma for acquisition of wealth and happiness in this life. In
the same way we can believe that the attainment of the higher planes of
existence after death is also due to the wholesome kamma. It has nothing to do
with God. God cannot make one who is without such wholesome kamma to be reborn
on a happy plane of existence. Those who have such kamma can attain the higher
states of existences although they do not pray to God. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Various
beneficial results in the next existence means either rebirth as a member of a
well-to-do or ruling family, or rebirth in the deva and Brahma world as a
powerful deva, sakka or Brahma and so forth. Hence the Buddha declares, 'sabbe
satta kammappatissarana.' <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[Note
on kammadayada: A being has two khandha: rupakkhanda and namakkhandha
(corporeality-group and mind-group). The corporeality group consists of head,
hands, legs, etc. Mind-group means thoughts and consciousness. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Of
these two, the corporeality group comes to dissolution once in each existence.
It has different shapes or forms in each existence. As for the mind-group,
there is no break in its process. It continually arises in succession from one
existence to another. Good kamma causes it to arise in successive happy
existences. Wherever the mind group arises, there a new and different
corporeality-group comes to be formed. The bad kamma causes the mind-group to
arise in lower states of existence.] <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Even

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Atthi
loke samanabrahmana samaggata sammapatipanna ye imanca lokam paranca lokam
sayam abhinna sacchikatva pavedenti. There are higher spiritual knowledge
(abhinna) and omniscience (sabbannuta-nana). Monks and brahmins who exert
themselves diligently in fulfilling the perfections (paramita) and practising samatha
and vipassana bhavana in this human world can achieve such nana. Personages who
have achieved such nana appear in this world from time to time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Of
these two kinds of nana, some are capable of gaining only abhinna and they can
see with this nana the four lower worlds, the six deva worlds, and some of the
Brahma worlds, as if with their natural eye. Some are capable of achieving both
abhinna and sabbannuta-nana and they can see clearly all of the countless
beings, infinite worlds and universes. Personages who have both nana are called
'Buddha'. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>These
two kinds of personages appear in this human world from time to time and impart
their knowledge of this world and the other worlds, but it is only a Buddha who
can explain the round of rebirths and existence of universes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Three
kinds of belief, namely: belief that those personages of higher spiritual
knowledge and omniscience appear in this world from time to time, belief in
them and their teachings, and belief in the existence of the other worlds,
constitute the right understanding or view. Those who have this right
understanding entertain no doubt that the Buddha, appears only in the human
world, and not in the heavenly worlds. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
other religions, where there is no such right understanding, they imagine that
the all-knowers, the all-seers, the omniscient ones appear only in the highest
heavens and not in the human world. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>However,
there are two kinds of power: the power of kamma and the power of nana. In the
case of kamma, the power of jhana is most effective. It can cause one to arise
in the highest plane as a Brahma with a long span of life. It cannot, however,
cause one to become an Omniscient Buddha. That Brahma has no nana with which he
can see all and know all. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Only
in this human world can one work for sabbannuta-nana, and only one who
perseveres diligently to achieve that nana can become omniscient. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It is
only in the Buddha Dhamma that profound, sublime and wonderful Teachings exist,
and it is because they belong to the sphere of nana (knowledge and wisdom). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
this life, to strive to become a wealthy person is one way, and to acquire
insight-knowledge and thus become a teacher of beings is another way. To strive
to become a great Brahma is similar to striving to become a wealthy man, and to
strive as a bhikkhu or hermit for acquiring insight-knowledge is like striving
to become a great teacher. Another example is: birds have wings to fly about in
the sky but they do not possess knowledge and wisdom like man. Men have
knowledge and wisdom but they have no wings and are unable to fly about in the
sky. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Brahma's kamma of jhana resembles the wings of birds. The insight-knowledge of
the monks and hermits resembles the knowledge and wisdom of men. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Brahmas and the devas live in the highest planes of existence due to the power
of jhana and kamma, but they have no insight-knowledge and omniscience. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thus
the right understanding (nana, knowledge or wisdom) which enables one to
believe: that the Buddha who sees all and knows all appears only in this human
world and not not in the higher planes of existence; that only the monks and
brahmins of the human race who are endowed with abhinna and subbannuta can
clearly discern the condition of the kappa and universes, the beings who are
running the round of samsara and how the wholesome and unwholesome kamma
operate; that the teachings of those monks and brahmins in the Sutta, Vinaya
and Abhidhamma are true, is known as'atthi loke samanabrahamana samma-ditthi'. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
wrong understanding or belief (miccha-ditthi) is that the God who knows all and
sees all cannot appear in the human world but only in the highest heavenly
abode, and that there cannot be many gods but only one, and that God, being the
highest and noblest, must be eternal and free from old age, disease, death,
etc. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Detailed
