      characteristics of the citta and cetasika that arise together and how each 
      is the paccaya on which the other depends, one would gradually attenuate 
      the attachment that mistakes realities for entities, people and the 
      selves.&nbsp; In order to show that realities are truly daily life 
      occurrences, I would like to talk about the first lobha-mula-citta namely 
      somanassa-sahagatam ditthigata-sampayuttam asankharikam, which is the

      without inducements</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+1>As the first lobha-mula-citta arises 
      and falls away with extreme rapidity, there must be as many as 19 cetasika 
      arising with it.&nbsp; Each cetasika would be a distinct reality, but they 
      must depend on one another to arise, perform their specific functions and 
      then fall away.&nbsp; Since we do not know this, at the instant 
      lobha-mula-citta arises there is 'us'.&nbsp; Therefore in just one single 
      instant the lobha-mula-citta could show 'anattaness'.&nbsp; When we know 
      that for the particular reality to arise there must be other realities 
      arising concurrently as reciprocal paccaya, helping one another to 
      arise.&nbsp; Without one another they could never arise at 
      all.</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The first lobha-mula-citta has 
      19 cetasika concurrently arising.&nbsp; I would like to speak of the 19 
      cetasika that arise with the lobha-mula-citta, or the 13 
      annasamana-cetasika and the 6 akusala-cetasika.</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+1>The annasamana cetasika comprise 7 
      sabba-citta-sadharana-cetasika and 6 pakinnaka-cetasika.&nbsp; The 7 
      sabba-citta-sadharana are phassa-, vedana-, sanna-, cetana-, ekaggata-, 
      jivitindriya- and manasikara-cetasika.</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+1>These 7 cetasika must arise with all 
      citta, no matter the type.&nbsp; Besides there are 6 pakinnaka-cetasika 
      that arise with some citta and not with others.&nbsp; For the first 
      lobha-mula-citta, however, all the 6 arise simultaneously, namely: 
      vitakka-, vicara-, adhimokka-, viriya-, piti- and 
      chanda-cetasika.</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+1>Of the 6 akusala-cetasika arising with 
      lobha-mula-citta, 4 are moha-, ahirika-, anottappa-, and 
      uddhacca-cetasika, which are the 4 akusala-cetasika that arise with all 
      akusala-citta.&nbsp; They are collectively called mocatukka since they are 
      the 4 akusala-sadharana-cetasika with moha as leader.&nbsp; 
      Lobha-mula-citta ditthigata-sampayutta has 2 more akusala-cetasika arising 
      concurrently: lobha- and ditthi-cetasika.&nbsp; One need not follow the 
      order of the paccaya when speaking of them,&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
      face=Georgia><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;but according to the characteristics of 
      paccaya of the citta and 19 cetasika that arise together in the first 
      lobha-mula-citta, as follows:</FONT></FONT> <BR>&nbsp; 
      <P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+2>1. Sahajata-paccaya</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+1>The word sahajata means to arise 
      simultaneously.&nbsp; Sahajata-paccaya means the reality that is paccaya 
      must arise concurrently with the paccayuppanna-dhamma. 
      <B>Paccayuppanna-dhamma</B> is the reality whose arising and existence the 
      paccaya assist and support.&nbsp; The citta and all 19 cetasika are 
      sahajata-paccaya; phassa-cetasika is paccaya for lobha-mula-citta and the 
      other accompanying 18 citta.</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+1>In the same manner the other cetasika 
      such as vedana that arise with this lobha-mula-citta would be paccaya for 
      the lobha-mula-citta as well as the other 18 cetasika.&nbsp; The citta 
      cannot arise without cetasika.&nbsp; The citta and the cetasika that 
      assist and support each other to arise must occur simultaneously.&nbsp; 
      There could never be ditthi or wrong view without lobha-cetasika 
      concurrently arising since when there is wrong view, there would be 
      pleasure in and attachment to the wrong view.&nbsp; Therefore the 
      ditthi-cetasika could never arise without lobha.&nbsp; But lobha-cetasika 
      could arise without ditthi-cetasika.&nbsp; It is normal in daily life 
      occurrences that lobha-mula-citta often arises through the eye, ear, nose, 
      tongue, body sense and mind.&nbsp; Whenever there is 
      lobha-mula-citta-ditthigata-sampayutta, there is wrong view arising 
      together with it.&nbsp; As to the first or the sahajata-paccaya, the 
      lobha-mula-citta arising concurrently with 19 cetasika, one being paccaya 
      for another and arising simultaneously: therefore they are 
      sahajata-paccaya.</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+1>The lobha-mula-citta is 
      sahajata-paccaya for the concurrently arising cetasika and the cetasika 
      that arises together with the lobha-mula-citta are sahajata-paccaya for 
      the lobha-mula-citta.&nbsp; Each instant of citta would have respective 
      kinds of cetasika arising with it according to the type of the specific 
      citta and cetasika.</FONT></FONT> <BR>&nbsp; 
      <P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+2>2. Sampayutta-paccaya</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+1>Sampayutta-paccaya is the reality that 
      is a nama-dhamma, which is paccaya uniquely for other nama-dhamma at the 
      instant they arise together.&nbsp; Since they can combine completely, they 
      are sampayutta-paccaya.&nbsp; They can blend because they are realities 
      that arise simultaneously, fall away at the same time, experience the same 
      arammana, and in the plane of the 5 khandha they must occur at the same 
      rupa also.&nbsp; This shows that the nama-dhamma can really totally 
      unite.&nbsp; In the case of a rupa-dhamma and a nama-dhamma, the rupa not 
      being the reality that experiences the arammana and a different kind of 
      reality from the nama-dhamma, they therefore are unable to blend together 
      as a nama-dhamma could with another nama-dhamma.</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+1>The nama-dhamma that are 
      sampayutta-paccaya would be sampayutta-paccaya in the instant they arise 
      together, not when they do not occur simultaneously.&nbsp; When&nbsp; a 
      citta arises, no matter the number of cetasika concurrent, both the citta 
      and the cetasika would be paccaya one for the other as sampayutta-paccaya, 
      since they combine completely at the instant they arise, know the same 
      arammana, fall away together and arise concurrently at the same 
      rupa.&nbsp; After the first instant of lobha-mula-citta has fallen away, 
      is the second lobha-mula-citta that arises in sequence a 
      sampayutta-paccaya?&nbsp; The first lobha-mula-citta is a nama-dhamma, as 
      is the second.&nbsp; But the former is not sampayutta-paccaya for the 
      latter, therefore we must correctly understand that only the citta and 
      cetasika that arise concurrently would be sahajata-paccaya since they 
      depend on one another and arise simultaneously.&nbsp; They are 
      sampayutta-paccaya because they are nama-dhamma that arise simultaneously, 
      know the same arammana concurrently, and in the plane of the 5 khandha, 
      must arise at the same rupa at the same instant, and then fall away 
      together.&nbsp; Therefore after the first lobha-mula-citta falls away, and 
      becomes paccaya for the second to arise, it is not through 
      sampayutta-paccaya.</FONT></FONT> <BR>&nbsp; 
      <P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+2>3. Annamanna-paccaya</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+1>Annamanna-paccaya: The name is Pali 
      but the characteristics of the realities need no names.&nbsp; We need 
      names only in order to show the quality of paccaya of realities that 
      depend on one another to arise.&nbsp; For realities to be paccaya by being 
      annamanna-paccaya, the paccaya and the paccayuppanna-dhamma each must 
      depend on the other.&nbsp; For example at the instant lobha-mula-citta 
      arises with the concurrent cetasika, the lobha-mula-citta would be 
      annamanna-paccaya for all the accompanying cetasika and all the cetasika 
      arising would be annamanna-paccaya for the lobha-mula-citta.&nbsp; That 
      is, the lobha-mula-citta would depend on the cetasika that are 
      paccayuppanna-dhamma, and the cetasika that are paccayuppanna-dhamma would 
      depend on the lobha-mula-citta that is paccaya.&nbsp; Both paccaya and 
      paccayuppanna-dhamma each must depend on the other for them to be 
      annamanna-paccaya.&nbsp; This is because some realities that are paccaya 
      for paccayuppanna-dhamma without depending on the paccayuppanna-dhamma in 
      the least.&nbsp; For example the citta is paccaya for the cittajarupa (or 
      the rupa that arise from the citta as samutthana, <B>samutthana being the 
      reality that composes the rupa</B>) to arise, while the cittajarupa is not 
      paccaya for the citta to arise.&nbsp; The cittajarupa must depend on the 
      citta as samutthana to arise: without the citta, the cittajarupa cannot 
      arise.&nbsp; For example in a dead person there is no more cittajarupa 
      because no citta arises.&nbsp; The citta is paccaya for cittajarupa to 
      arise, therefore the citta is paccaya and the cittajarupa paccayuppanna at 
      the instant that citta and cittajarupa arise simultaneously.&nbsp; Thus 
      the citta and cittajarupa are not annamanna-paccaya for each 
      other.</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+1>Annamanna-paccaya are like three 
      sticks that must rely one on the others to stay upright; take one away and 
      they would not be able to stand.&nbsp; Whenever the citta is 
      annamanna-paccaya, one must know that the realities that are 
      paccayuppanna-dhamma caused by the citta must also be relied on by the 
      citta which is the paccaya.&nbsp; Otherwise they would not be 
      annamanna-paccaya.&nbsp; The reality that is paccaya depend on the 
      realities that are paccayuppanna in the same way that the realities that 
      are paccayuppanna rely on the reality that is paccaya.&nbsp; The realities 
      are annamanna-paccaya or dependant one on the other to arise, for example, 
      the citta and the cetasika depend on each other to arise, therefore the 
      citta and the cetasika are annamanna-paccaya one for another.&nbsp; The 
      four mahabhuta-rupa comprising the earth, water, fire and wind elements 
      are annamanna-paccaya one for another.&nbsp; In the same manner that the 
      earth element is paccaya for water, fire and wind elements to arise, the 
      water element is also annamanna-paccaya for the earth, fire and wind 
      elements.&nbsp; Among the four dhatu, one would be annamanna-paccaya for 
      another.&nbsp; In the same instant of citta that arises, there are several 
      paccaya that condition the citta and concurrent cetasika that arise and 
      fall away together, and the paccaya are none other than the citta, 
      cetasika and rupa.</FONT></FONT> <BR>&nbsp; 
      <P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+2>4. Nissaya-paccaya</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+1>Nissaya-paccaya is the reality that is 
      paccaya for paccayuppanna dhamma by being the base for the 
      paccayuppanna-dhamma.&nbsp; The word<B> 'nissaya' </B>means 
      <B>dwelling</B>.&nbsp; Both citta and cetasika are nissaya-paccaya each 
      for the other.&nbsp; In the bhumi of the 5 khandha such as the human 
      bhumi, the citta and the cetasika must depend on the rupa to arise, the 
      citta cannot arise outside the body rupa.&nbsp; Therefore what is the 
      nissaya-paccaya or the basis for the first lobha-mula-citta, which is 
      somanassa-sahagatam ditthigata-sampayuttam asankharikam, to arise?&nbsp; 
      Whatever rupa the lobha-mula-citta arises at, that rupa is the 
      nissaya-paccaya by being the basis for the lobha-mula-citta.</FONT></FONT> 

      <P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+1>Through the eyes, at the moment of 
      seeing, the cakkhu-vinnana arises at the cakkhuppasada, therefore the 
      cakkhuppasada is nissaya-paccaya, the base of arising to the 
      cakkhu-vinnana.&nbsp; In the bhumi of the 5 khandha there are 6 rupa which 
      are the birthplace of the citta:</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+1>1. Cakkhuppasada is the place of

      that are the nissaya-paccaya of the 10 dvi-panca-vinnana citta 
      respectively, there is also the hadaya-rupa that is the arising place for 
      all citta except for the 10 dvi-panca-vinnana citta.&nbsp; The hadaya 
      -rupa is therefore the nissaya-paccaya for almost all citta in the bhumi 
      of the 5 khandha.&nbsp; Since the hadaya-vatthu is the nissaya-paccaya for 
      lobha-mula-citta to arise, is the lobha-mula-citta nissaya-paccaya for 
      hadaya-vatthu to arise?&nbsp; No, because hadaya-vatthu is the rupa that 
      is the birthplace for the citta in the bhumi of the five khandha but the 
      citta, which is a nama-dhamma, is not the basis for the birth of 
      rupa.&nbsp; There are 4 samutthana for rupa, or the 4 realities that 
      compose the rupa, namely: kamma, citta, utu, and ahara.&nbsp; As to the 
      citta that is the samutthana for rupa to arise, it only does so for the 
      cittajarupa, not for rupa that arise from other samutthana.&nbsp; 
      Therefore the citta is not paccaya for pasada-rupa, which are rupa that 
      arise from kamma as samutthana.</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+1>The word 'nissaya' means 
      dwelling.&nbsp; In Thai the word nissay is used to mean what is often done 
      until it becomes a habit, which is also its meaning in Pali.&nbsp; In the 
      Vinaya, the newly ordained bhikkhu would habitually frequent the upajjhaya 
      (preceptor) or depend on his teachings to progress until he is no longer a 
      newly ordained bhikkhu.</FONT></FONT>

      lobha-mula-citta is nissaya-paccaya for the citta arising together with it 
      as well as to the other cetasika that arise in the same citta.&nbsp; This 
      is the paticcasamuppada, from the perspective of the 'paccayaness'.&nbsp;

      paccaya.</FONT></FONT> <BR>&nbsp;

      <P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+1>Upanissaya-paccaya is the reality that 
      is the strong birthplace for other realities to arise, but the 
      upanissaya-paccaya is the reality that is paccaya <B>by being a strong 
      birthplace for realities that do not arise concurrently with it</B>.&nbsp; 
      There are three upanissaya-paccaya:</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+1>1.

      Pakatupanissaya-paccaya</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+1>As arammanupanissaya-paccaya, the 
      lobha-mula-citta-ditthigata-sampayutta is the strong base by being the 
      arammana of the lobha-mula-citta that is arising in the present.&nbsp; 
      When there is wrong view evolving with pleasure and attachment in 
      the</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;wrong view as 
      strong arammana the lobha-mula-citta-ditthigata-sampayutta would arise to 
      think frequently of the reality, thus it would be a strong base by being 
      the arammana.&nbsp; For example, in the instant there is pleasure and 
      satisfaction in wrong view in the practice that the person regards as 
      right view, there would be paccaya to think often of the pleasure in the 
      wrong view.</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+1>The same applies to 
      anantarupanissaya-paccaya: the falling away of the last lobha-mula-citta 
      would be paccaya as strong birthplace for the next lobha-mula-citta to 
      arise subsequently in the same javana-vithi.&nbsp; The last 
      lobha-mula-citta would be paccaya for the tadalambana-citta or bhavanga to 
      arise by being anantarupanissaya-paccaya.</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+1>Pakatupanissaya-paccaya is a strong 
      birthplace for daily, habitually performed or accumulated realities.&nbsp; 
      When the lobha-mula-citta has arisen and fallen away, the realities that 
      had arisen with the citta would accumulate in the subsequent citta.&nbsp; 
      Having thought and done something, there would be accumulated strength to 
      make the same kind of lobha-mula-citta arise again.</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+1>Besides the 
      lobha-mula-citta-ditthigata-sampayutta, or the lobha-mula-citta arising

      pleasure in or has different habits concerning what is seen through the 
      eyes, sound that is heard through the ears, different smells, tastes, 
      clothing, objects, utensils, stories or even fun and games.&nbsp; This is 
      because there has been that satisfaction before, accumulated liking for 
      such things, and having done them, they would be pakatupanissaya-paccaya: 
      the usual strong birthplace for what has been done and accumulated.&nbsp; 
      The Buddha manifested the Jataka or stories from the past when such and 
      such events took place and the accumulations of the persons in the long 
      time past.</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+1>Not only do each of us think, say, do, 
      like or dislike certain things in this lifetime; but we must have done, 
      thought, said, liked and disliked in that way before in the past.&nbsp; 
      Therefore it became paccaya to think, say or do the same things once more, 
      no matter with any kind of kusala or akusala citta.&nbsp; This is because

      <P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+1>Sujin:&nbsp; The patisandhi-citta that 
      arises in a lifetime is <B>the result of only one kamma</B>.&nbsp; 
      Throughout samsara-vatta rebirths as pretty or not, akusala or kusala 
      citta that arise in infinite numbers cannot be estimated.&nbsp; The result 
      of kusala kamma must always be good things.&nbsp; Beautiful people are 
      certainly the results of kusala-kamma, when it were the result of 
      akusala-kamma, the rupa would not be pretty.&nbsp; The patisandhi-citta 
      arises together with the rupa, kammaja-rupa, which is the result of just 
      one kamma, but all the other kamma accumulated in samsara-vatta are 
      numerous.&nbsp; Has there ever been jealousy?&nbsp; Conceit?&nbsp; 
      Stinginess?&nbsp; Crookedness?&nbsp; Rivalry?&nbsp; All the akusala are 
      still accumulated in the citta, nothing is gone.&nbsp; One kamma causes 
      beauty in a rebirth but all the akusala accumulated would show as a 
      pretty, unintelligent person, or in some other aspects, through 
      pakatupa-nissaya-paccaya.&nbsp; But there are also good, beautiful people 
      who have also accumulated a lot of kusala kamma, with gentle hearts, metta 
      and karuna.&nbsp; Or they could be ariya-puggala who are beautiful all 
      around, with supreme sati and panna of the arahanta level such as 
      Bimba-Yasodhara, whose beauty only the Buddha's surpassed, as possible 
      example.&nbsp; Even bodily appearance could show past kamma: a good 
      looking person is the result of kusala-kamma, but when a beautiful person 
      is not good, it shows akusala-citta accumulated in the past, even though 
      born beautiful, there is still jealousy because there has been a lot of 
      jealousy accumulated.</FONT></FONT>

      <P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+1>Sujin:&nbsp; In the past when the 
      Buddha had not attained parinibbana, there were examples of the 
      ariya-puggala whose accumulated akusala would be strong enough to do 
      diverse physical or verbal actions, before listening to the dhamma.&nbsp; 
      This shows that when the lokuttara-panna has not yet arisen, there is no 
      way to extinguish any akusala.&nbsp; Physical and verbal actions would 
      have to evolve with the strength of the specific akusala.&nbsp; Lobha, 
      which is attachment, is one kind of very strong akusala, comparable to a 
      rubber tree saturated with rubber, whenever the knife cuts it, there would 
      be rubber oozing out.</FONT></FONT>

      kilesa, the lokuttara-panna would arise making him an ariya.&nbsp; Before 
      that, however, everyone would be full of all kinds of akusala.&nbsp; None 
      has uniquely kusala-citta void of any kind of akusala in the least.&nbsp; 
      While there are still rebirths, kamma would make us born pretty or ugly,

      immediately abandoned this lifetime, otherwise how very hard it would it 
      be like in the next rebirth?&nbsp; For the bad person, no matter the

      never crossed my mind.</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+1>Sujin:&nbsp; Could we pay respect with 
      reason because each would do things differently according to their 
      knowledge, way of thinking, and understanding.&nbsp; While others worship 
      we might respectfully think of the deva's beneficence or present causes 
      for the deva who might be there or not, to have empathetic joy.&nbsp; 
      Whether they are there or not, whether it is a tree or a spirit house, one 
      might remember that to be born a deva must be because of kusala.&nbsp; For 
      someone to be born in heaven is the result of good deeds.&nbsp; To think 
      of the good of deva is with kusala-citta.&nbsp; Even though the apparent 
      action is like everyone else's but those who are mindful of the 
      beneficence of deva could be done with understanding.</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+1>Audience:&nbsp; Yes, I have never 
      thought of that before.</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+1>Sujin:&nbsp; If one worships in order 
      to ask for something such as blessings, one should know correctly that 
      whatever blessings we ask for, we must also perform kusala in order to get 
      them ourselves too.&nbsp; If anyone asks for blessings one should tell 
      them to make lots of merit in order to get the said blessings.&nbsp; Would 
      they ask for them then?&nbsp; Since they must do good to merit the 
      blessings they wish to receive, otherwise they would not get 
      them.</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+1>Audience:&nbsp; I have this problem: 
      on Asal?hapuja Day they had 'merit-making' ceremonies at the school.&nbsp; 
      I was at the altar and a professor brought me the rice to be offered to 
      the statue of the Buddha.&nbsp; I did not know what to do, so I took it 
      and offered it, and paid my respect.&nbsp; I did not speak of the matter 
      to make him understand, which might be my fault.&nbsp; This professor was 
      also ordained for several years.</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+1>Sujin:&nbsp; Traditions, if studied 
      and understood from the logic of Buddhism, could render the citta kusala 
      at that instant.&nbsp; In the days when the Buddha had not attained 
      parinibbana, there were dana offered to the Bhikkhu with the Buddha 
      presiding, and even after his parinibbana there were worship with flowers, 
      incense and candles, and other scents.&nbsp; That there are amisapuja 
      (material offering) although he had attained the absolute parinibbana 
      shows the respect, honor and worship in his honor, and no matter the 
      offering of food to the bhikkhu in any era they are still considered 
      bhikkhu who still have the Sammasambuddha the arahanta 
      presiding.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+1>Audience:&nbsp; The problem is that 
      the others do not know this, they do not have the panna to.&nbsp; Is it 
      harmful that others misunderstand?</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+1>Sujin:&nbsp; For others, it is their 
      affair to gradually understand.&nbsp; It is impossible for the individual 
      to take responsibility for the whole world.&nbsp; We must first understand 
      ourselves correctly for others to slowly increase their consideration of 
      the logic.&nbsp; There are some things that are done following traditions, 
      some without understanding, and after studying there could be kusala 
      instead of akusala citta at the instants we perform the specific 
      actions.&nbsp; Have you ever paid respect to the deva in a forest?&nbsp; 
      Could we not honor them with some respect?&nbsp; Could we not dedicate 
      some kusala to them (for them to anumodana) without any disrespect?&nbsp; 
      Of course we could, but with kusala-citta.&nbsp; In order to dedicate 
      kusala to the deva who might be in the home, could we?&nbsp; Yes, because 
      it depends on the understanding and the kusala citta that arise at that 
      instant.&nbsp; But without understanding, the instant would be 
      lobha-mula-citta ditthigata-sampayuttam depending whether there were 
      upekkha-vedana or somanassa-vedana, asankharikam of sasankharikam as hetu-

      the cetasika that are nama-dhamma arising together with it.&nbsp; Among 
      the sahajata-dhamma that are nama-dhamma that arise together as 
      sampayutta-dhamma, the chief must be one of the 4 sahajatadhipati-paccaya, 
      either chanda, viriya, citta or vimamsa as chief.&nbsp; There is no panna 
      arising with the lobha-mula-citta, however, so each instant that 
      lobha-mula-citta arises, the&nbsp; principal element would be either 
      chanda, viriya or citta but never vimamsa or panna, since panna is a 
      sobhana-dhamma.</FONT></FONT>

      <P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+1>All beings are maintained by 
      food.&nbsp; While there is still food, we remain animals and people.&nbsp; 
      Once the food is eliminated, and there is no more nourishment, the 
      realities of animals and people would cease to exist.</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+1>There are four kinds of realities that 
      are ahara-paccaya, that nourish and support their sahajata-dhamma, 
      comprising a rupa food and three nama food.&nbsp; The rupa-ahara is 
      kavallinkarahara consisting of the food taken by mouth.&nbsp; The three 
      nama-ahara are phassahara, consisting of phassa-cetasika; 
      manosancetanahara, consisting of cetana-cetasika; and vinnanahara, 
      consisting of the citta.&nbsp; None could stop these 4 ahara from arising 
      when there is paccaya to condition them.</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT size=+1>The first lobha-mula-citta has the 3 
      nama-ahara, namely phassahara, manosancetanahara and vinnanahara.&nbsp; 
      What ahara is the first lobha-mula-citta itself?&nbsp; It is the 
      vinnanahara since it is a citta.&nbsp; What does it cause?&nbsp; At the 
      moment of its arising it conditions the concurrent cetasika and also the 
      rupa in the planes with the 5 rupa-khandha.&nbsp; Except for the 
      patisandhi, dvi-panca-vinnana, arupavacara-vipaka and the cuti-citta of 
      the arahanta, all citta are conditions for the cittajarupa to arise.&nbsp; 
      Therefore whenever the lobha-mula-citta arises, it is a vinnanahara 
      conditions the cetasika and citta that arise together with it.&nbsp; 
      Besides, the cetana-cetasika that arises with the lobha-mula-citta also is 
      manosancetanahara.&nbsp; This shows that in a single instant that 
      lobha-mula-citta arises simultaneously with 19 cetasika, each reality that 
      arise concurrently would be diverse kinds of paccaya for the others: by 
      being hetu, adhipati and ahara-paccaya, among others.&nbsp; In addition, 
      the phassa-cetasika that arises with the lobha-mula-citta is also 
      phassahara because it brings other cetasika, the citta and the 
      cittajarupa.&nbsp; When one speaks of the citta as paccaya for the rupa, 
      one intends all the citta and cetasika that arise concurrently as paccaya 
      for the rupa to arise, according to the kind of citta.</FONT></FONT>

      cetasika by being natthi-paccaya.&nbsp; If a citta arises and has not yet

      natthi-paccaya for the third lobha-mula-citta to arise.&nbsp; Therefore 
      all citta and cetasika that arise together would be paccaya that no longer 
      exist and thus natthi-paccaya for the next citta to arise. In other words, 
      the succeeding citta and cetasika which are the paccayuppanna must only 
      arise after the preceding citta has fallen away, and exists no

      manifested both from the perspective of being paccaya of the reality and

      anantara-paccaya because all rupa arise from their specific samutthana and

      sequence according to the order of the status of the respective
