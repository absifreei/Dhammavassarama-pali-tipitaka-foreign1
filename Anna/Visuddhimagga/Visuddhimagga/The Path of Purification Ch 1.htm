      <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=+1><BR>1. &nbsp; [1] 'When a wise man, 
        established well in Virtue,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Develops Consciousness and 
        Understanding,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then as a bhikkhu ardent and 
        sagacious<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He 
        succeeds in disentangling this tangle' (S.i,13).<BR>&nbsp; This was 
        said. But why was it said? While the Blessed One was living at Savatthi, 
        it seems, a certain deity came to him in the night, and in order to do 
        away with his doubts he asked this question:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The inner tangle and the outer 
        tangle -<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        This generation is entangled in a tangle.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so I ask of Gotama this 
        question:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Who succeeds in disentangling this tangle?' (S.i,13).<BR>2. &nbsp; Here 
        is the meaning in brief. <I>Tangle</I> is a term for the network of 
        craving. For that is a tangle in the sense of lacing together, like the 
        tangle called network of branches in bamboo thickets, etc., because it 
        goes on arising again and again up and down <A name=1txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm01.html#1fn">{1}</A> among the 
        objects [of consciousness] beginning with what is visible. But it is 
        called <I>the inner tangle and the outer tangle</I> because it arises 
        [as craving] for one's own requisites and another's, for one's own 
        person and another's, and for the internal and external bases [for 
        consciousness]. Since it arises in this way, <I>this generation is 
        entangled in a tangle.</I> As the bamboos, etc. are entangled by the 
        bamboo tangle so too this generation, in other words, this order of 
        living beings, is all entangled by the tangle of craving - the meaning 
        is that it is intertwined, interlaced by it. [2] And because it is 
        entangled like this, <I>so I ask of Gotama this question,</I> that is 
        why I ask this. He addressed the Blessed One by his race name as 
        <I>Gotama. Who succeeds in disetangling this tangle:</I> who may 
        disentangle this tangle that keeps the three kinds of existence 
        entangled in this way? - What he asks is, who is capable of 
        disentangling it?<BR>3. &nbsp; However, when questioned thus, the 
        Blessed One, whose knowledge of all things is unimpeded, Deity of 
        Deities, excelling Sakka [Ruler of Gods], excelling Brahma, fearless in 
        the possession of the four kinds of perfect confidence, Wielder of the 
        Ten Powers, All-seer with unobstructed knowledge, uttered this stanza in 
        reply to explain the meaning:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp; 'When a wise man, established well in 
        Virtue,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Develops Consciousness and Understanding,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then as a bhikkhu ardent and 
        sagacious<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He 
        succeeds in disentangling this tangle'.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; * 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * 
        <BR>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My task is 
        now to set out the true sense,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Divided into virtue and the 
        rest,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of 
        this same verse composed by the Great Sage.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are here in the Victor's 
        Dispensation<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Seekers gone forth from home to homelessness,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And who although desiring 
        purity<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have 
        no right knowledge of the sure straight way<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comprising virtue and the other 
        two,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right 
        hard to find, that leads to purity -<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who, though they strive, here gain 
        no purity.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        To them I shall expound the comforting Path<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Purification, pure in 
        expositions,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Relying on the teaching of the dwellers<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Great Monastery; <A 
        name=2txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm01.html#2fn">{2}</A> let all 
        those<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good 
        men who do desire purity<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listen intently to my exposition.<BR>5. &nbsp; 
        Herein, <I>purification</I> should be understood as nibbana, which being 
        devoid of all stains, is utterly pure. The <I>Path of Purification</I> 
        is the path to that purification; it is the means of approach that is 
        called the <I>path.</I> The meaning is, I shall expound that path of 
        purification.<BR>6. &nbsp; In some instances this path of purification 
        is taught by insight alone, <A name=3txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm01.html#3fn">{3}</A> according as it 
        is said:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        'Formations are all impermanent:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he sees thus with 
        understanding<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And turns away from what is 
        ill,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is 
        the path to purity' (Dh.277). [3]<BR>And in some instances by jhana and 
        understanding according as it is said:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He is near unto 
        nibbana<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 
        whom are jhana and understanding' (Dh. 372).<BR>And in some instances by 
        deeds (kamma), etc., according as it is said:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'By deeds, vision and 
        righteousness,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By virtue, the sublimest life -<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By these are mortals 
        purified,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        And not by lineage and wealth' (M.iii,262).<BR>And in some instances by 
        virtue, etc. according as it is said:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He who is possessed of constant 
        virtue,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has 
        understanding, and is concentrated,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is strenuous and diligent as 
        well,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will 
        cross the flood, so difficult to cross' (S.i,53).<BR>And in some 
        instances by the Foundations of Mindfulness, etc., according as it is 
        said: 'Bhikkhus, this path is the only way for the purification of 
        beings, ... for the realization of nibbana, that is to say, the four 
        Foundations of Mindfulness' (D.ii,290); and similarly in the case of the 
        Right Efforts, and so on. But in the answer to this question it is 
        taught by virtue and the other two.<BR>7. &nbsp; Here is, a brief 
        commentary [on the stanza]. <I>Established well in virtue:</I> standing 
        on virtue. It is only one actually fulfilling virtue who is here said to 
        'stand on virtue'. So the meaning here is this: being established well 
        in virtue by fulfilling virtue. <I>A man:</I> a living being. 
        <I>Wise:</I> possessing the kind of understanding that is born of kamma 
        by means of a rebirth-linking with triple root-cause. <I>Develops 
        Consciousness and Understanding:</I> develops both concentration and 
        insight. For it is concentration that is described here under the 
        heading of 'consciousness', and insight under that of 'understanding'. 
        <A name=4txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm01.html#4fn">{4}</A> <I>Ardent 
        (atapin):</I> possessing energy. For it is energy that is called 'ardour 
        <I>(atapa)'</I> in the sense of burning up and consuming 
        <I>(atapana-paritapana)</I> defilements. He has that, thus he is ardent. 
        <I>Sagacious:</I> it is understanding that is called 'sagacity'; 
        possessing that, is the meaning. This word shows protective 
        understanding. For understanding is mentioned three times in the reply 
        to the question. Herein, the first is native understanding, the second 
        is understanding consisting in insight, while the third is the 
        protective understanding that guides all affairs. He sees fear 
        <I>(bhayam ikkhati)</I> in the round of rebirths, thus he is a 
        <I>bhikkhu. He succeeds in disentangling this tangle:</I> [4] Just as a 
        man standing on the ground and taking up a well-sharpened knife might 
        disentangle a great tangle of bamboos, so too, he - this bhikkhu who 
        possesses the six things, namely, this virtue, and this concentration 
        described under the heading of consciousness, and this threefold 
        understanding, and this ardour -, standing on the ground of virtue and 
        taking up with the hand of protective-understanding exerted by the power 
        of energy the knife of insight-understanding well-sharpened on the stone 
        of concentration, might disentangle, cut away and demolish all the 
        tangle of craving that had overgrown his own life's continuity. But it 
        is at the moment of the Path that he is said to be disentangling that 
        tangle: at the moment of fruition he has disentangled the tangle and is 
        worthy of the highest offerings in the world with its deities. That is 
        why the Blessed One said:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'When a wise man, established well in 
        Virtue,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Develops Consciousness and Understanding,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then as a bhikkhu ardent and 
        sagacious<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He 
        succeeds in disentangling this tangle'.<BR>8. &nbsp; Herein there is 
        nothing for him to do about the [native] understanding on account of 
        which he is called <I>wise;</I> for that has been established in him 
        simply by the influence of previous kamma. But the words <I>ardent and 
        sagacious</I> mean that by persevering with energy of the kind here 
        described and by acting in full awareness with understanding he should, 
        having become well established in virtue, develop the serenity and 
        insight that are described as <I>Concentration and Understanding.</I> 
        This is how the Blessed One shows the path of purification under the 
        headings of virtue, concentration and understanding there.<BR>9. &nbsp; 
        What has been shown so far is the three trainings, the dispensation that 
        is good in three ways, the necessary condition for the threefold 
        clear-vision, etc., the avoidance of the two extremes and the 
        cultivation of the middle way, the means to surmounting the states of 
        loss, etc., the abandoning of defilements in three aspects, prevention 
        of transgression, etc., purification from the three kinds of 
        defilements, and the reason for the states of Stream-entry and so on. 
        How?<BR>10. &nbsp; Here the training of higher virtue is shown by 
        <I>Virtue;</I> the training of higher consciousness, by 
        <I>Concentration;</I> and the training of higher understanding, by 
        <I>Understanding.</I><BR>&nbsp; The dispensation's goodness in the 
        beginning is shown by Virtue. Because of the passage 'And what is the 
        beginning of profitable things? Virtue that is quite purified' 
        (S.v,14-3), and because of the passage beginning 'The not doing of any 
        evil' (Dh.183), <I>Virtue</I> is the beginning of the dispensation. And 
        that is good because it brings about the special qualities of 
        non-remorse, <A name=5txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm01.html#5fn">{5}</A> and so on. Its 
        goodness in the middle is shown by <I>Concentration.</I> [5] Because of 
        the passage beginning 'Entering upon the profitable' (Dh.183), 
        <I>Concentration</I> is the middle of the dispensation. And that is good 
        because it brings about the special qualities of supernormal-power, and 
        so on. Its goodness in the end is shown by <I>Understanding.</I> Because 
        of the passage 'The purifying of One's own mind - this is the Buddhas' 
        dispensation' (Dh.183), and because understanding is its culmination, 
        <I>Understanding</I> is the end of the dispensation. And that is good 
        because it brings about equipoise with respect to the desired and the 
        undesired. For this is said:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Just as a solid massive rock<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remains unshaken by the 
        wind,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So 
        too, in face of blame and praise<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wise remain immovable' 
        (Dh.81).<BR>11. &nbsp; Likewise the necessary condition for the triple 
        clear-vision is shown by Virtue. For with the support of perfected 
        virtue one arrives at the three kinds of clear-vision, but nothing 
        besides that. The necessary condition for the six kinds of 
        direct-knowledge is shown by <I>Concentration.</I> For with the support 
        of perfected concentration one arrives at the six kinds of 
        direct-knowledge, but nothing besides that. The necessary condition for 
        the categories of discrimination is shown by <I>Understanding.</I> For 
        with the support of perfected understanding one arrives at the four 
        kinds of discrimination, but not for any other reason. <A 
        name=6txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm01.html#6fn">{6}</A> <BR>&nbsp; And 
        the avoidance of the extreme called devotion to indulgence of 
        sense-desires is shown by <I>Virtue.</I> The avoidance of the extreme 
        called devotion to mortification of self is shown by 
        <I>Concentration.</I> The cultivation of the middle way is shown by 
        <I>Understanding.</I><BR>12. &nbsp; Likewise the means for surmounting 
        the states of loss is shown by <I>Virtue;</I> the means for surmounting 
        the element of sense-desires, by <I>Concentration;</I> and the means for 
        surmounting all becoming, by <I>Understanding.</I> And the abandoning of 
        defilements by substitution of opposites is shown by <I>Virtue;</I> that 
        by suppression is shown by <I>Concentration;</I> and that by cutting off 
        is shown by <I>Understanding.</I><BR>13. &nbsp; Likewise prevention of 
        defilements' transgression is shown by <I>Virtue;</I> prevention of 
        obsession [by defilement] is shown by <I>Concentration;</I> prevention 
        of inherent tendencies is shown by <I>Understanding.</I><BR>&nbsp; And 
        purification from the defilement of misconduct is shown by 
        <I>Virtue;</I> purification from the defilement of craving, by 
        <I>Concentration;</I> and purificatipn from the defilement of [false] 
        views, by <I>Understanding.</I> [6]<BR>14. &nbsp; Likewise the reason 
        for the states of Stream-entry and Once-return is shown by 
        <I>Virtue;</I> that for the state of Non-return, by 
        <I>Concentration;</I> that for Arahantship, by <I>Understanding.</I> For 
        the Stream-enterer is called 'Perfected in the kinds of virtue'; and 
        likewise the Once-returner. But the Non-returner is called 'Perfected in 
        concentration'. And the Arahant is called 'Perfected in understanding' 
        (See A.i,233).<BR>15. &nbsp; So thus far these nine and other like 
        triads of special qualities have been shown, that is, the three 
        trainings, the dispensation that is good in three ways, the necessary 
        condition for the threefold clear-vision, the avoidance of the two 
        extremes and the cultivation of the middle way, the means for 
        surmounting the states of loss etc., the abandoning of defilements in 
        three aspects, prevention of transgression, etc., purification from the 
        three kinds of defilements, and the reason for the states of 
        Stream-entry and so on.<BR><BR></FONT>

        this path of purification is shown in this way under the headings of 
        Virtue, Concentration and Understanding, each comprising various special 
        qualities, it is still only shown extremely briefly. And so since that 
        is insufficient to help all there is in order to show it in detail the 
        following set of questions dealing in the first place with 
        Virtue:<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (i) What is virtue?<BR>&nbsp; 
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(ii) In what sense is it virtue?<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
        &nbsp; (iii) What are its characteristic, function, manifestation, and 
        proximate cause?<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (iv) What are the benefits of 
        virtue?<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; (v) How many kinds of virtue are 
        there?<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (vi) What is the defiling of 
        it?<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(vii) What is the cleansing of it?<BR>17. 
        &nbsp; Here are the answers:<BR>&nbsp; (i) WHAT IS VIRTUE? It is the 
        states beginning with volition present in one who abstains from killing 
        living things, etc., or in one who fulfils the practice of the duties. 
        For this is said in the Patisambhida: What is virtue? There is virtue as 
        volition, virtue as consciousness-concomitant, <A name=7txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm01.html#7fn">{7}</A> virtue as 
        restraint, [7] virtue as non-transgression' (Ps.i,44).<BR>&nbsp; Herein, 
        <I>Virtue as volition</I> is the volition present in one who abstains 
        from killing living things, etc., or in one who fulfils the practice of 
        the duties. <I>Virtue as consciosness-concomitant</I> is the abstinence 
        in one who abstains from killing living things, and so on. Furthermore, 
        <I>Virtue as volition</I> is the seven volitions [that accompany the 
        first seven] of the [ten] courses of action (kamma) in one who abandons 
        the killing of living things, and so on. <I>Virtue as 
        consciousness-concomitant</I> is the [three remaining] states consisting 
        of noncovetousness, non-ill-will, and right view, stated in the way 
        beginning 'Abandoning covetousness, he dwells with mind free from 
        covetousness' (D.i,71).<BR>18. &nbsp; <I>Virtue as restraint</I> should 
        be understood here as restraint in five ways: restraint by the Rules of 
        the Community <I>(Patimokkha),</I> restraint by mindfulness, restraint 
        by knowledge, restraint by patience, and restraint by energy. Herein, 
        'restraint by the Patimokkha' is this: 'He is furnished, fully 
        furnished, with this Patimokkha restraint' (Vbh. 246); 'Restraint by 
        mindfulness' is this: 'He guards the eye faculty, enters upon restraint 
        of the eye faculty' (D.i,70). 'Restraint by knowledge' is 
        this:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The 
        currents in the world that flow, Ajita,"<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; said the Blessed 
        One,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are 
        stemmed by means of mindfulness;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restraint of currents I 
        proclaim,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By 
        understanding they are dammed" (Sn.1035);<BR>and use of requisites is 
        here combined with this. But what is called 'restraint by patience' is 
        that given in the way beginning 'He is one who bears cold and heat' 
        (M.i,10). And what is called 'restraint by energy' is that given in the 
        way beginning 'He does not endure a thought of sense-desires when it 
        arises' (M.i,11); purification of livelihood is here combined with this. 
        So this five-fold restraint, and the abstinence, in clansmen who dread 
        evil, from any chance of transgression met with, should all be 
        understood to be 'virtue as restraint'.<BR>&nbsp; <I>Virtue as 
        non-transgression</I> is the non-transgression, by body or speech, of 
        precepts of virtue that have been undertaken.<BR>&nbsp; This in the 
        first place is the answer to the question 'What is virtue?'. [8] Now as 
        to the rest. -<BR>19. &nbsp; (ii) IN WHAT SENSE IS IT VIRTUE? It is 
        virtue <I>(sila)</I> in the sense of composing <I>(silana).</I><A 
        name=8txt></A> <A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm01.html#8fn">{8}</A> What is this 
        composing? It is either a coordinating <I>(samadhana),</I> meaning 
        non-inconsistency of bodily action, etc., due to virtuousness; or it is 
        an upholding <I>(upadharana),</I> {8} meaning a state of basis 
        <I>(adhara)</I> owing to its serving as foundation for profitable 
        states. For those who understand etymology admit only these two 
        meanings. Others, however, comment on the meaning here in the way 
        beginning 'The meaning of virtue <I>(sila)</I> is the meaning of head 
        <I>(siras),</I> the meaning of virtue is the meaning of cool 
        <I>(sitala).'</I><BR>20. &nbsp; (iii) Now WHAT ARE ITS CHARACTERISTIC, 
        FUNCTION, MANIFESTATION, AND PROXIMATE CAUSE? Here<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The characteristic of it is 
        composing <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Even when analysed in various ways, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As visibility is of visible data 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even when 
        analysed in various ways.<BR>Just as visibleness is the characteristic 
        of the visible-data base even when analysed into the various categories 
        of blue, yellow, etc., because even when analysed into these categories 
        it does not exceed visibleness, so also this same composing, described 
        above as the coordinating of bodily action, etc., and as the foundation 
        of profitable states, is the characteristic of virtue even when analysed 
        into the various categories of volition, etc., because even when 
        analysed into these categories it does not exceed the state of 
        coordination and foundation.<BR>21. &nbsp; While such is its 
        characteristic,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its <I>function</I> has a double 
        sense:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        <I>Action</I> to stop misconduct, then<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Achievement as the 
        quality<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of 
        blamelessness in virtuous men.<BR>So what is called virtue should be 
        understood to have the function (nature) of stopping misconduct as its 
        function (nature) in the sense of action, and a blameless function 
        (nature) as its function (nature) in the sense of achievement. For under 
        [these headings of] characteristic, etc., it is action <I>(kicca)</I> or 
        it is achievement <I>(sampatti)</I> that is called 'function 
        <I>(rasa</I> - nature)'.<BR>22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Now virtue, so 
        say those who know,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Itself as purity will show;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And for its proximate cause they 
        tell<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
        pair, conscience and shame, as well. [9]<BR>&nbsp;This virtue is 
        manifested as the kinds of purity stated, thus: 'Bodily purity, verbal 
        purity, mental purity' (A.i,271); it is manifested, comes to be 
        apprehended, as a pure state. But conscience and shame are said by those 
        who know to be its proximate cause; its near reason, is the meaning. For 
        when conscience and shame are in existence, virtue arises and persists; 
        and when they are not, it neither arises nor persists.<BR>&nbsp; This is 
        how virtue's characteristic, function, manifestation, and proximate 
        cause, should be understood.<BR>23. &nbsp; (iv) WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF 
        VIRTUE? Its benefits are the acquisition of the several special 
        qualities beginning with non-remorse. For this is said: 'Ananda, 
        profitable, habits (virtues) have non-remorse as their aim and, 
        non-remorse as their benefit' (A.v,1). Also it is said further 
        'Householder, there are these five benefits for the virtuous in the 
        perfecting of virtue. What five? Here, householder, one who is virtuous, 
        possessed of virtue, comes into a large fortune as a consequence of 
        diligence; this is the first benefit for the virtuous in the perfecting 
        of virtue. Again, of one who is virtuous, possessed of virtue, a fair 
        name is spread abroad; this is the second benefit for the virtuous in 
        the perfecting of virtue. Again, whenever one who is virtuous, possessed 
        of virtue, enters an assembly, whether of khattiyas, (warrior nobles) or 
        brahmans or householders or ascetics, he does so without fear or 
        hesitation; this is the third benefit for the virtuous in the perfecting 
        of virtue. Again one who is virtuous, possessed of virtue, dies 
        unconfused; this is the fourth benefit for the virtuous in the 
        perfecting of virtue. Again, one who is virtuous, possessed of virtue, 
        on the break up of the body, after death, reappears in a happy destiny, 
        in the heavenly world; this is the fifth benefit for the virtuous in the 
        perfecting of virtue' (D.ii,86). There are also the many benefits of 
        virtue beginning with being dear and loved and ending with destruction 
        of cankers described in the passage beginning 'If a bhikkhu should wish 
        "May I be dear to my fellows in the life of purity and loved by them, 
        held in respect and honoured by them", let him perfect the virtues' 
        (M.i.33). This is how virtue has as its benefits the several special 
        qualities beginning with non-remorse. [10] <BR>24. &nbsp; 
        Furthermore,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Dare anyone a limit place<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On benefits that virtue brings,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without which virtue clansmen 
        find<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No 
        footing in the dispensation?<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No Ganges, and no Yamuna,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No Sarabhu, 
        Sarassati,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Or flowing Aciravati,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or noble River of Mahi,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is able to wash out the 
        stain<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 
        things that breathe here in the world;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For only virtue's water 
        can<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wash out 
        the stain in living things.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No breezes that come bringing 
        rain,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No 
        balm of yellow sandalwood,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No necklaces beside, or gems,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or soft effulgence of 
        moonbeams,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Can here avail to calm and soothe<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Men's fevers in this world; 
        whereas<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This 
        noble, this supremely cool,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well-guarded virtue quells the 
        flame.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where 
        is there to be found the scent<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That can with virtue's scent 
        compare,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And 
        that is borne against the wind<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As easily as with it? Where<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can such another stair be found 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That 
        climbs, as virtue does, to heaven?<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or yet another door that 
        gives<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Onto 
        the City of Nibbana?<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shine as they may, there are no 
        kings<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Adorned with jewelry and pearls<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That shine as does a man 
        restrained<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Adorned with virtue's ornament.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Virtue entirely does away<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With dread of self-blame and the 
        like;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their 
        virtue to the virtuous<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gives gladness always by its 
        fame.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From 
        this brief sketch it may be known<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How virtue brings reward, and 
        how<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This 
        root of all good qualities<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robs of its power every fault.<BR>25. &nbsp; (v) Now 
        here is the answer to the question, HOW MANY KINDS OF VIRTUE ARE 
        THERE?<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;1. Firstly all this virtue is of one kind by 
        reason of its own characteristic of composing.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;2. It is 
        of two kinds as keeping and avoiding.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;3. Likewise as 
        that of good behaviour and that of the beginning of the life of 
        purity.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;4. As abstinence and non-abstinence,<BR>&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;5. As dependent and independent,<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;6. As temporary 
        and lifelong,<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;7. As limited and unlimited.<BR>&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;8. As mundane and supramundane. [11] <BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;9. It is of 
        three kinds as inferior, medium, and superior.<BR>&nbsp; 10. Likewise as 
        giving precedence to self, giving precedence to the world, and giving 
        precedence to the Dhamma (Law).<BR>&nbsp; 11. As adhered to, not adhered 
        to, and tranquillized.<BR>&nbsp; 12. As purified, unpurified,and 
        dubious.<BR>&nbsp; 13. As that of the Trainer, that of the Non-trainer, 
        and that of the neither-trainer-nor-non-trainer.<BR>&nbsp; 14. It is of 
        four kinds as partaking of diminution, of stagnation, of distinction, of 
        penetration.<BR>&nbsp; 15. Likewise as that of bhikkhus, of bhikkhunis, 
        of the not-fully-admitted, of the-laity,<BR>&nbsp; 16. As natural, 
        customary, necessary, due to previous causes,<BR>&nbsp; 17. As virtue of 
        Patimokkha restraint, of restraint of sense faculties, of purification 
        of livelihood, and that concerning requisites.<BR>&nbsp; 18. It is of 
        five kinds as virtue consisting in limited purification, etc.; for this 
        is said in the Patisambhida: 'Five kinds of virtue: virtue consisting in 
        limited purification, virtue consisting in unlimited purification, 
        virtue consisting in fulfilled purification, virtue consisting in 
        unadhered-to purification, virtue consisting in tranquillized 
        purification' (Ps.1,42).<BR>&nbsp; 19. Likewise as abandoning, 
        refraining, volition, restraint, and non-transgression.<BR>26. &nbsp; 1. 
        Herein, in the section dealing with that of one kind,the meaning should 
        be understood as already stated.<BR>&nbsp; 2. In the section dealing 
        with that of two kinds: fulfilling a training precept announced by the 
        Blessed One thus 'This should be done' is <I>keeping;</I> not doing what 
        is prohibited by him thus 'This should not be done' is <I>avoiding.</I> 
        Herein, the word-meaning is this; they keep <I>(caranti)</I> within 
        that, they proceed as people who fulfil the virtues, thus it is keeping 
        <I>(caritta);</I> they preserve, they protect, avoidance, thus it is 
        <I>avoiding.</I> Herein, <I>keeping</I> is accomplished by faith and 
        energy; <I>avoiding,</I> by faith and mindfulness. This is how it is of 
        two kinds as keeping and avoiding. <BR>27. &nbsp; 3. In the second dyad 
        good behaviour is the best kind of behaviour. Good behaviour itself is 
        <I>that of good behaviour;</I> or what is announced for the sake of good 
        behaviour is <I>that of good behaviour.</I> This is a term for virtue 
        other than that which has livelihood as eighth. <A name=9txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm01.html#9fn">{9}</A> It is the 
        initial stage of the life of purity consisting in the path, thus it is 
        <I>that of the beginning of the life of purity.</I> This is a term for 
        the virtue that has livelihood as eighth. It is the initial stage of the 
        path because it has actually to be purified in the prior stage too. 
        Hence it is said 'But his bodily action, his verbal action, and his 
        livelihood, have already been purified earlier' (M.iii,289). Or the 
        training precepts called 'lesser and minor' (D.ii,154) [12] are <I>that 
        of good behaviour;</I> the rest are <I>that of the beginning of the life 
        of purity.</I> Or what is included in the Double Code (the Bhikkhus' and 
        Bhikkhunis' <I>Patimokkha)</I> is <I>that of the beginning of the life 
        of purity;</I> and that included in the duties set out in the Khandhakas 
        [of the Vinaya] is <I>that of good behaviour.</I> Through its perfection 
        <I>that of the beginning of the life of purity</I> comes to be 
        perfected. Hence it is said also 'that this bhikkhu shall fulfil the 
        state consisting in the beginning of the life of purity without having 
        fulfilled the state consisting in good behaviour - that is not possible' 
        (A.iii,14-15). So it is of two kinds as that of good behaviour and that 
        of the beginning of the life of purity.<BR>28. &nbsp; 4. In the third 
        dyad virtue as <I>abstinence</I> is simply abstention from killing 
        living things etc.; the other kinds consisting in volition, etc., are 
        virtue as <I>non-abstinence.</I> So it is of two kinds as abstinence and 
        non-abstinence.<BR>29. &nbsp; 5. In the fourth dyad there are two kinds 
        of dependence: dependence through craving and dependence through [false] 
        views. Herein, that produced by one who wishes for a fortunate kind of 
        becoming thus 'Through this virtuous conduct, (rite) I shall become a 
        [great] deity or some [minor] deity' (M.i,102) is <I>dependent</I> 
        through craving. That produced through such [false] view about 
        purification as 'Purification is through virtuous conduct (rites)' 
        (Vbh.374) is <I>dependent</I> through [false] view. But the 
        supramundane, and the mundane that is the pre-requisite for the 
        aforesaid supramundane, are <I>independent.</I> So it is of two kinds as 
        dependent and independent.<BR>30. &nbsp; 6. In the fifth dyad 
        <I>temporary</I> virtue is that undertaken after deciding on a time 
        limit. <I>Lifelong</I> virtue is that practised in the same way but 
        undertaking it for as long as life lasts. So it is of two kinds as 
        temporary and lifelong.<BR>31. &nbsp; 7. In the sixth dyad the 
        <I>limited</I> is that seen to be limited by gain, fame, relatives, 
        limbs, or life. The opposite is <I>unlimited.</I> And this is said in 
        the Patisambhida. 'What is the virtue that has a limit? There is virtue 
        that has gain as its limit, there is virtue that has fame as its limit, 
        there is virtue that has relatives as its limit, there is virtue that 
        has limbs as its limit, there is virtue that has life as its limit. What 
        is virtue that has gain as its limit? Here someone with gain as cause, 
        with gain as condition, with gain as reason, transgresses a training 
        precept as undertaken: that virtue has gain as its limit' (Ps.i;43), 
        [13] and the rest should be elaborated in the same way. Also in the 
        answer dealing with the unlimited it is said 'What is virtue that does 
        not have gain as its limit? Here someone does, not with gain as cause, 
        with gain as condition, with gain as reason, even arouse the thought of 
        transgressing a training precept as undertaken, how then shall he 
        actually transgress it? That virtue does not have gain as its limit' 
        (Ps.i,44), and the rest should be elaborated in the same way. So it is 
        of two kinds as limited and unlimited.<BR>32. &nbsp; 8. In the seventh 
        dyad all virtue subject to cankers is <I>mundane;</I> that not subject 
        to cankers is <I>supramundane.</I> Herein, the <I>mundane</I> brings 
        about improvement in future becoming and is a prerequisite for the 
        escape from becoming, according as it is said: 'Discipline is for the 
        purpose of restraint, restraint is for the purpose of non-remorse, 
        non-remorse is for the purpose of gladdening, gladdening is for the 
        purpose of happiness, happiness is for the purpose of tranquillity, 
        tranquillity is for the purpose of bliss, bliss is for the purpose of 
        concentration, concentration is for the purpose of correct knowledge and 
        vision, correct knowledge and vision is for the purpose of dispassion, 
        dispassion is for the purpose of fading away [of greed], fading away is 
        for the purpose of deliverance, deliverance is for the purpose of 
        knowledge and vision of deliverance, knowledge and vision of deliverance 
        is for the purpose of complete extinction [of craving etc.] through not 
        clinging. Talk has that purpose, counsel has that purpose, support has 
        that purpose, giving ear has that purpose, that is to say, the 
        liberation of the mind through not clinging' (Vin.v,164). The 
        <I>supramundane</I> brings about the escape from becoming and is the 
        plane of Reviewing Knowledge. So it is of two kinds as mundane and 
        supramundane. <BR>33. &nbsp; 9. In the first of the triads the 
        <I>inferior</I> is produced by inferior zeal, [purity of] consciousness, 
        energy, or inquiry; the <I>medium</I> is produced by medium zeal, etc.; 
        the <I>superior,</I> by superior [zeal, and so on]. That undertaken out 
        of desire for fame is inferior, that undertaken out of desire for the 
        fruits of merit is medium, that undertaken for the sake of the noble 
        state thus 'This has to be done' is <I>superior.</I> Or again that 
        defiled by self-praise and disparagement of others etc., thus 'I am 
        possessed of virtue, but these other bhikkhus are ill-conducted and 
        evil-natured' (M.i,193) is <I>inferior;</I> undefiled mundane virtue is 
        <I>medium;</I> supramundane is <I>superior.</I> Or again that motivated 
        by craving, the purpose of which is to enjoy continued existence, is 
        <I>inferior;</I> that practised for the purpose of one's own deliverance 
        is <I>medium;</I> the virtue of the perfections practised for the 
        de1iverance of all beings is <I>superior.</I> So it is of three kinds as 
        inferior, medium, and superior. <BR>34. &nbsp; 10. &nbsp; In the second 
        triad that practised out of self-regard by one who regards self and 
        desires to abandon what is unbecoming to self [14] is virtue <I>giving 
        precedence to self.</I> That practised out of regard for the world and 
        out of desire to ward off the censure of the world is virtue <I>giving 
        precedence to the world.</I> That practised out of regard for the Dhamma 
        (Law) and out of desire to honour the majesty of the Dhamma is virtue 
        <I>giving precedence to the Dhamma.</I> So it is of three kinds as 
        giving precedence to self, and so on.<BR>35. &nbsp; 11. &nbsp; In the 
        third triad the virtue that in the dyads was called 'dependent' (no. 5) 
        is <I>adhered-to</I> because it is adhered-to through craving and 
        [false] view. That practised by the magnanimous ordinary man as the 
        prerequisite of the path, and that associated with the path in Trainers, 
        are <I>not-adhered-to.</I> That associated with trainers' and 
        non-trainers' fruition is <I>tranquillized.</I> So it is of three kinds 
        as adhered-to, and so on.<BR>36. &nbsp; 12. In the fourth triad that 
        fulfilled by one who has committed no offence or has made amends after 
        committing one is <I>pure.</I> So long as he has not made amends after 
        committing an offence it is <I>impure.</I> Virtue in one who is dubious 
        about whether a thing constitutes an offence or about what grade of 
        offence has been committed or about whether he has committed an offence 
        is <I>dubious.</I> Herein, the meditator should purify impure virtue. If 
        dubious, he should avoid cases about which he is doubtful and should get 
        his doubts cleared up. In this way his mind will be kept at rest. So it 
        is of three kinds as pure, and so on.<BR>37. &nbsp; 13. In the fifth 
        triad the virtue associated with the four paths and with the [first] 
        three fruitions is <I>that of the trainer.</I> That associated with the 
        fruition of Arahantship is <I>that of the non-trainer.</I> The remaining 
        kinds are <I>that of the neither-trainer-nor-non-trainer.</I> So it is 
        of three kinds as that of the Trainer, and so on.<BR>38. &nbsp; But in 
        the world the nature of such and such beings is called their 'habit 
        <I>(sila)',</I> of which they say 'This one is of happy habit 
        <I>(sukha-sila),</I> this one is of unhappy habit, this one is of 
        quarrelsome habit, this one is of dandified habit'. Because of that it 
        is said in the Patisambhida figuratively 'Three kinds of virtue (habit); 
        profitable virtue, unprofitable virtue, indeterminate virtue' (Ps.i,44). 
        So it is also called of three kinds as profitable, and so on. Of these, 
        the unprofitable is not included here since it has nothing whatever to 
        do with the heads beginning with the characteristic, which define virtue 
        in the sense intended in this [chapter]. So the threefoldness should be 
        understood only in the way already stated.<BR>39. &nbsp; 14. In the 
        first of the tetrads:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The unvirtuous he 
        cultivates,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He visits not the virtuous,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in his 
        ignorance he sees<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No fault in a transgression here, 
        [15]<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With wrong thoughts often in his 
        mind<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His faculties he will not guard<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Virtue in such 
        a constitution<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comes to <I>partake of 
        diminution.</I><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he whose mind is 
        satisfied<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With virtue that has been 
        achieved,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who never thinks to stir 
        himself<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And take a meditation subject 
        up,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contented with mere 
        virtuousness,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor striving for a higher state 
        -<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His virtue bears the 
        appellation<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of <I>that partaking of 
        stagnation.</I><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But who, possessed of virtue, 
        strives<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With concentration for his aim - 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That bhikkhu's virtue in its 
        function<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is called <I>partaking of 
        distinction.</I><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who finds mere virtue not 
        enough<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But has dispassion for his goal - 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His virtue through such 
        aspiration<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comes to <I>partake of penetration.</I><BR>&nbsp; So 
        it is of four kinds as partaking of diminution, and so on.<BR>40. &nbsp; 
        15. In the second tetrad there are training precepts announced for 
        bhikkhus to keep irrespective of what is announced for bhikkhunis. This 
        is the virtue <I>of bhikkkus.</I> There are training precepts announced 
        for bhikkhunis to keep irrespective of what is announced for bhikkhus. 
        This is the virtue of <I>bhikkhunis.</I> The ten precepts of virtue for 
        male and female novices are the virtue of the <I>not fully admitted.</I> 
        The five training precepts - ten when possible - as a permanent 
        undertaking, and eight as the factors of the Uposatha Day, <A 
        name=10txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm01.html#10fn">{10}</A> for male and 
        female lay followers are the virtue <I>of the laity.</I> So it is of 
        four kinds as the virtue of bhikkhus, and so on.<BR>41. &nbsp; 16. In 
        the third tetrad the non-trangression on the part of Uttarakuru human 
        beings is <I>natural virtue.</I> Each clan's or locality's, or sect's, 
        own rules of conduct are <I>customary virtue.</I> The virtue of the 
        Bodhisatta's mother described thus, 'It is the necessary rule, Ananda, 
        that when the Bodhisatta has descended into his mother's womb, no 
        thought of men that is connected with the cords of sense desire comes to 
        her' (D.ii,13) is <I>necessary virtue.</I> But the virtue pure beings as 
        Maha-Kassapa, etc., and of the Bodhisatta in his various births is 
        virtue <I>due to previous causes.</I> So it of four kinds as natural 
        virtue, and so on.<BR>42. &nbsp; 17, In the fourth tetrad:<BR>&nbsp; 
        <I>(a)</I> the virtue described by the Blessed One thus, 'Here a bhikkhu 
        dwells restrained with the Patimokkha restraint, possessed of the 
        [proper] conduct and resort, and seeing fear in the slightest fault, he 
        trains himself by undertaking the precepts of training' (Vbh.244), is 
        <I>virtue of restraint.</I><BR>&nbsp; <I>(b)</I> that described thus, 
        'On seeing a visible object with the eye, [16] he apprehends neither the 
        signs nor the particulars through which, if he left the eye faculty 
        unguarded, evil and unprofitable states of covetousness and grief might 
        invade him, he enters upon the way of its restraint, he guards the eye 
        faculty, undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty. On hearing a sound 
        with the ear ... On smelling an odour with the nose ... On tasting a 
        flavour with the tongue ... On touching a tangible object with the body 
        ... On cognizing a mental object with the mind, he apprehends neither 
        the signs nor the particulars through which, if he left the mind faculty 
        unguarded, evil and unprofitable states of covetousness and grief might 
        invade him, he enters upon the way of its restraint, he guards the mind 
        faculty, undertakes the restraint of the mind faculty (M.i,180), <I>is 
        virtue of the restraint of the sense faculties.</I><BR>&nbsp; <I>(c)</I> 
        Abstinence from such wrong livelihood as entails transgression of the 
        six training precepts announced with respect to livelihood and entails 
        the evil states beginning with 'Scheming, talking, hinting, belittling, 
        pursuing gain with gain' (M.iii,75) is <I>virtue of livelihood 
        purification.</I><BR>&nbsp; <I>(d)</I> Use of the four requisites that 
        is purified by the reflection stated in the way beginning 'Reflecting 
        wisely, he uses the robe only for protection from cold' (M.i.10) is 
        called <I>virtue concerning requisites.</I><BR>43. &nbsp; Here is an 
        explanatory exposition together with a word-commentary, starting from 
        the beginning.<BR>&nbsp; <I>(a) Here:</I> in this dispensation. <I>A 
        bhikkhu:</I> a clansman who has gone forth out of faith and is so styled 
        because he sees fear in the round of rebirths <I>(samsare bhayam 
        ikkhanata)</I> or because he wears cloth garments that are torn and 
        pieced together, and so on. <BR>&nbsp; <I>Restrained with the Patimokkha 
        restraint;</I> here <I>'Patimokkha</I> (Rule of the Community)' <A 
        name=11txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm01.html#11fn">{11}</A> is the virtue 
        of the training precepts; for it frees <I>(mokkheti)</I> him who 
        protects (pati) it, guards it, it sets him free <I>(mocayati)</I> from 
        the pains of the states of loss, etc., that is why it is called 
        <I>'Patimokkha'.</I> 'Restraint' is restraining; this is a term for 
        bodily and verbal non-transgression. The Patimokkha itself as restraint 
        is 'Patimokkha restraint'. 'Restrained with the Patimokkha restraint' is 
        restrained by means of the restraint consisting in that Patimokkha; he 
        has it, possesses it, is the meaning. <I>Dwells:</I> bears himself in 
        one of the postures. [17]<BR>44. &nbsp; The meaning of <I>possessed of 
        [the proper] conduct and resort</I> etc., should be understood in the 
        way in which it is given in the text. For this is said: 'Possessed of 
        [the proper] conduct and resort: there is [proper] conduct and improper 
        conduct. Herein, what is improper conduct? Bodily transgression, verbal 
        transgression, bodily and verbal transgression - this is called improper 
        conduct. Also all unvirtuousness is improper conduct. Here someone makes 
        a livelihood by gifts of bamboos, or by gifts of leaves, or by gifts of 
        flowers, fruits, bathing powder, and tooth sticks, or by flattery, or by 
        bean-soupery, or by fondling, or by going on errands on foot, or by one 
        or other of thc sorts of wrong livelihood condemned by the Buddhas - 
        this is called improper conduct. Herein, what is [proper] conduct? 
        Bodily non-transgression, verbal non-transgression, bodily and verbal 
        non-transgression - this is called [proper] conduct. Also all restraint 
        through virtue is [proper] conduct. Here someone does not make a 
        livelihood by gifts of bamboos, or by gifts of leaves, or by gifts of 
        flowers, fruits, bathing powder, and tooth sticks, or by flattery, or by 
        bean-soupery, or by fondling, or by going on errapds on foot, or by one 
        or other of the sorts of wrong livelihood condemned by the Buddhas - 
        this is called [proper] conduct. <BR>45. &nbsp; '[Proper] resort: there 
        is [proper] resort and improper resort. Herein, what is improper resort? 
        Here someone has prostitutes as resort, or he has widows, old maids, 
        eunuchs, bhikkhunis, or taverns as resort; or he dwells associated with 
        kings, kings' ministers, sectarians, sectarians' disciples, in 
        unbecoming association with laymen; or he cultivates, frequents, 
        honours, such families as are faithless, untrusting, abusive and rude, 
        who wish harm, wish ill, wish woe, wish no surcease of bondage, for 
        bhikkhus and bhikkhunis, for male and female devotees [18] - this is 
        called improper resort. Herein, what is [proper] resort? Here someone 
        does not have prostitutes as resort ... or taverns, as resort; he does 
        not dwell associated with kings, ... sectarians' disciples, in 
        unbecoming association with laymen; he cultivates, frequents, honours, 
        such families as are faithful and trusting, who are a solace, where the 
        yellow cloth glows, where the breeze of sages blows, who wish good, wish 
        well, wish joy, wish surcease of bondage, for bhikkhus and bhikkhunis, 
        for male and female devotees - this is called [proper] resort. Thus he 
        is furnished with, fully furnished with, provided with, fully provided 
        with, supplied with, posssessed of, endowed with, this [proper] conduct 
        and this [proper] resort. Hence it is said "Possessed of [the proper] 
        conduct and resort"' (Vbh.246-7).<BR>46. &nbsp; Furthermore [proper] 
        conduct and resort should also be understood here in the following way; 
        for improper conduct is twofold as bodily and verbal. Herein, what is 
        bodily improper conduct? 'Here someone acts disrespectfully before the 
        Community, and he stands jostling elder bhikkhus, sits jostling them, 
        stands in front of them, sits in front of them, sits on high seat, sits 
        with his head covered, talks standing up, talks waving his arms, ... 
        walks with sandals while elder bhikkhus walk without sandals, walks on a 
        high walk while they walk on a low walk, walks on a walk while they walk 
        on the ground, ... stands pushing elder bhikkhus, sits pushing them, 
        prevents new bhikkhus from getting a seat, ... and in the bath house ... 
        without asking elder bhikkhus he puts wood on [the stove], ... bolts the 
        door, ... and at the bathing place he enters the water jostling elder 
        bhikkhus, enters it in front of them, bathes jostling them, bathes in 
        front of them, comes out jostling them, comes out in front of them, ... 
        and entering inside a house he goes jostling elder bhikkhus, goes in 
        front of them, pushing forward he goes in front of them, ... and where 
        families have inner private screened rooms in which the women of the 
        family, ... the girls of the family, sit, there he enters abruptly, and 
        he strokes a child's head' (Nd1.228-9). This is called bodily improper 
        conduct. <BR>47. &nbsp; Herein, what is verbal improper conduct? 'Here 
        someone acts disrespectfully before the Community. Without asking elder 
        bhikkhus he talks on the Dhamma, answers questions, recites the 
        Patimokkha, talks standing up, [19] talks waving his arms, ... having 
        entered inside a house, he speaks to a woman or a girl thus "You, 
        so-and-so of such-and-such a clan, what is there? Is there rice gruel? 
        Is there cooked rice? Is there any hard food to eat? What shall we 
        drink? What hard food shall we eat? What soft food shall we eat? Or what 
        will you give me?" - he chatters like this' (Nd1.230). This is called 
        verbal improper conduct. <BR>48. &nbsp; Proper conduct should be 
        understood in the opposite sense to that. Furthermore, a bhikkhu is 
        respectful, deferential, possessed of conscience and shame, wears his 
        inner robe properly, wears his upper robe properly, his manner inspires 
        confidence whether in moving forwards or backwards, looking ahead or 
        aside, bending or stretching, his eyes are downcast, he has (a good) 
        deportment, he guards the doors of his sense faculties, knows the right 
        measure in eating, is devoted to wakefulness, possesses mindfulnes and 
        full-awareness, wants little, is contented, is strenuous, is a careful 
        observer of good behaviour, and treats the teachers with great respect. 
        This is called (proper) conduct. This firstly is how (proper) conduct 
        should be understood.<BR>49. &nbsp; (Proper) resort is of three kinds: 
        (proper) resort as support, (proper) resort as guarding, and (proper) 
        resort as anchoring.<BR>&nbsp; Herein, what is (proper) resort as 
        support? A good friend who exhibits the ten instances of talk, <A 
        name=12txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm01.html#12fn">{12}</A> in whose 
        presence one hears what has not been heard, corrects what has been 
        heard, gets rid of doubt, rectifies one's view, and gains confidence: or 
        by training under whom one grows in faith, virtue, learning, generosity 
        and understanding - this is called (proper) resort as support.<BR>50. 
        &nbsp; What is (proper) resort as guarding? Here 'A bhikkhu, having 
        entered inside a house, having gone into a street, goes with downcast 
        eyes, seeing the length of a plough yoke, restrained, not looking at an 
        elephant, not looking at a horse, a carriage, a pedestrian, a woman, a 
        man, not looking up, not looking down, not staring this way and that' 
        (Nd 1. 474). This is called <I>(Proper) resort as 
        guarding.</I><BR>51.&nbsp; &nbsp;What is (proper) resort as anchoring? 
        It is the four foundations of mindfulness on which the mind is anchored; 
        for this is said by the Blessed One: 'Bhikkhus, what is a bhikkhu's 
        resort, his own native place? It is these four foundations of 
        mindfulness' (S.v,148). This is called <I>(proper) resort as 
        anchoring.</I><BR>&nbsp; Being thus furnished with... endowed with, this 
        (proper) conduct and this (proper) resort, he is also on that account 
        called 'one possessed of (proper) conduct and resort'. (20)<BR>52. 
        &nbsp; <I>Seeing fear in the slightest fault</I> (&sect;42): one who has the 
        habit <I>(sila)</I> of seeing fear in faults of the minutest measure, of 
        such kinds as unintentional contravening of a minor training rule of the 
        Patlmokkha, as an unprofitable thought. <I>He trains himself by 
        undertaking (samadaya) the precepts of training:</I> whatever there is 
        among the precepts of training to be trained in, in all that he trains 
        by taking it up rightly <I>(samma adaya).</I> And here, as far as the 
        words 'one restrained by the Patimokkha restraint', virtue of Patimokkha 
        restraint is shown by Discourse in Terms of Persons. <A 
        name=13txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm01.html#13fn">{13}</A> But all that 
        beginning with the words 'possessed of (proper) conduct and resort' 
        should be understood as said in order to show the way of practice that 
        perfects that virtue in him who so practises it.<BR>53. &nbsp; 
        <I>(b)</I> Now as regards the virtue of restraint of faculties shown 
        next to that in the way beginning 'on seeing a visible object with the 
        eye', herein, <I>'he'</I> is a bhikkhu established in the virtue of 
        Patimokkha restraint. <I>On seeing a visible object with the eye:</I> on 
        seeing a visible object with the eye-consciousness that is capable of 
        seeing visible objects and has borrowed the name 'eye' from its 
        instrument. But the Ancients <I>(Porana)</I> said 'The eye does not see 
        a visible object because it has no mind. The mind does not see because 
        it has no eyes. But when there is the impingement of door and object he 
        sees by means of the consciousness that has eye-sensitivity as its 
        physical basis. Now (an idiom) such as this is called an "accessory 
        locution <I>(sasambharakatha)", </I>like "He shot him with his bow", and 
        so on. So the meaning here is this: "On seeing a visible object with 
        eye-consciousness,"'. <A name=14txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm01.html#14fn">{14}</A> <BR>54. 
        &nbsp; <I>Apprehends neither the signs:</I> he does not apprehend the 
        sign of woman or man, or any sign that is a basis for defilement such as 
        the sign of beauty, etc.: he stops at what is merely seen. <I>Nor the 
        particulars:</I> he does not apprehend any aspect classed as hand, foot, 
        smile, laughter, talk, looking ahead, looking aside, etc., which has 
        acquired the name 'particular <I>(anubyanjana)'</I> because of its 
        particularizing <I>(anu anu byanjanato)</I> defilements, because of its 
        making them manifest themselves. He only apprehends what is really 
        there. Like the Elder Maha-Tissa who dwelt at Cetiyapabbata.<BR>55. 
        &nbsp; It seems that as the Elder was on his way from Cetiyapabbata to 
        Anuradhapura for alms, a certain daughter-in-law of a clan, who had 
        quarrelled with her husband and had set out early from Anuradhapura all 
        dressed up and tricked out like a celestial nymph to go to her 
        relatives' home, saw him on the road, and being low-minded, [21] she 
        laughed a loud laugh. [Wondering] 'What is that ?', the Elder looked up, 
        and finding in the bones of her teeth the perception of foulness 
        (ugliness), he reached Arahantship. <A name=15txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm01.html#15fn">{15}</A> Hence it was 
        said:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He saw 
        the bones that were her teeth,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And kept in mind his first 
        perception;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        And standing on that very spot<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Elder became an Arahant.<BR>But her husband who 
        was going after her saw the Elder and asked 'Venerable sir, did you by 
        any chance see a woman?'. The Elder told him:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it was a man or 
        woman<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That 
        went by I noticed not;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But only that on this high road<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There goes a group of bones.<BR>56. &nbsp; 
        As to the words <I>through which,</I> etc., the meaning is: by reason of 
        which, because of which non-restraint of the eye faculty, <I>if he,</I> 
        if that person, <I>left the eye faculty unguarded,</I> remained with the 
        eye door unclosed by the door-panel of mindfulness, <I>these states of 
        covetousness,</I> etc., <I>might invade,</I> might pursue, might 
        threaten, <I>him. He enters upon the way of its restraint:</I> he enters 
        upon the way of closing that eye faculty by the door-panel of 
        mindfulness. It is the same one of whom it is said <I>he guards the eye 
        faculty, undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty.</I><BR>57. &nbsp; 
        Herein, there is neither restraint nor non-restraint in the actual eye 
        faculty, since neither mindfulness nor forgetfulness arises in 
        dependence on eye-sensitivity. On the contrary when a visible datum as 
        object comes into the eye's focus, then, after the life-continuum has 
        arisen twice and ceased, the functional mind-element accomplishing the 
        function of adverting arises and ceases. After that, eye-consciousness 
        with the function of seeing; after that, resultant mind element with the 
        function of receiving; after that, resultant root-cause-less 
        mind-consciousness-element with the function of investigating; after 
        that, functional root-cause-less mind-consciousness-element 
        accomplishing the function of determining arises and ceases. Next to 
        that, impulsion impels. <A name=16txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm01.html#16fn">{16}</A> Herein, there 
        is neither restraint nor non-restraint on the occasion of the 
        life-continuum, or on any of the occasions beginning with adverting. But 
        there is non-restraint if unvirtuousness or forgetfulness or unknowing 
        or impatience or idleness arises at the moment of impulsion. When this 
        happens, it is called 'non-restraint in the eye faculty'. [22]<BR>58. 
        &nbsp; Why is that? Because when this happens, the door is not guarded, 
        nor are the life-continuum and the consciousnesses of the cognitive 
        series. Like what? Just as, when a city's four gates are not secured, 
        although inside the city house doors, storehouses, rooms, etc., are 
        secured, yet all property inside the city is unguarded and unprotected 
        since robbers coming in by the city gates can do as they please, so too, 
        when unvirtuousess, etc., arise in impulsion in which there is no 
        restraint; then the door too is unguarded, and so also are the 
        life-continuum and the consciousness of the cognitive series beginning 
        with adverting. But when virtue, etc., has arisen in it, then the door 
        too is guarded and so also are the life-continuum and the 
        consciousnesses of the cognitive series beginning with adverting. Like 
        what? Just as, when the city gates are secured, although inside the city 
        the houses, etc., are not secured, yet all property inside the city is 
        well guarded, well protected, since when the city gates are shut there 
        is no ingress for robbers, so too, when virtue, etc., have arisen in 
        impulsion, the door too is guarded and so also are the life-continuum 
        and the consciousnesses of the cognitive series beginning with 
        adverting. Thus although it actually arises at the moment of impulsion, 
        it is nevertheless called 'restraint in the<BR>59. eye faculty'. So also 
        as regards the phrases <I>on hearing a sound with the ear</I> and so on. 
        So it is this virtue which in brief has the characteristic of avoiding 
        apprehension of signs entailing defilement with respect to visible 
        objects, etc., that should be understood as <I>Virtue of restraint of 
        faculties.</I><BR>60. &nbsp; <I>(c)</I> Now as regards the virtue of 
        livelihood purification mentioned above next to the virtue of restraint 
        of the faculties (&sect;42), the words <I>of the six precepts announced on 
        account of livelihood</I> mean, of the following six training precepts 
        announced thus: 'With livelihood as cause, with livelihood as reason, 
        one of evil wishes, a prey to wishes, lays claim to a higher than human 
        state that is non-existent, not a fact', the contravention of which is 
        Defeat; 'With livelihood as cause, with livelihood as reason, he acts as 
        go-between', the contravention of which is an offence entailing a 
        Meeting of the Order; 'With livelihood as cause, with livelihood as 
        reason, he says "A bhikkhu who lives in your monastery is an Arahant"', 
        the contravention of which is a Serious Offence in one who is aware of 
        it; 'With livelihood as cause, with livelihood as reason, a bhikkhu who 
        is not sick eats superior food that he has ordered for his own use', the 
        contravention of which is an offence Requiring Expiation; 'With 
        livelihood as cause, with livelihood as reason, a bhikkhuni who is not 
        sick eats superior food that she has ordered for her own use'; the 
        contravention of which is an Offence Requiring Confession; 'With 
        livelihood as cause, with livelihood as reason, one who is not sick eats 
        curry or boiled rice [23] that he has ordered for his own use', the 
        contravention of which is an Offence of Wrongdoing (Vin.v,146). Of these 
        six precepts.<BR>61. &nbsp; As regards <I>scheming,</I> etc. (&sect;42), this 
        is the text: 'Herein, what is scheming? It is the grimacing, grimacery, 
        scheming, schemery, schemedness, <A name=17txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm01.html#17fn">{17}</A> by what is 
        called rejection of requisites or by indirect talk, or it is the 
        disposing, posing, composing, of the deportment on the part of one bent 
        on gain, honour and renown, of one of evil wishes, a prey to wishes - 
        this is called scheming.<BR>62. &nbsp; 'Herein, what is talking? Talking 
        at others, talking, talking round, talking up, continual talking up, 
        persuading, continual persuading; suggesting, continual suggesting, 
        ingratiating chatter, flattery, bean-soupery, fondling, on the part of 
        one bent on gain, honour and renown, of one of evil wishes, a prey to 
        wishes - this is called talking.<BR>63. &nbsp; 'Herein, what is hinting? 
        A sign to others, giving a sign, indication, giving indication, indirect 
        talk, roundabout talk, on the part of one bent on gain, honour and 
        renown, of one of evil wishes, a prey to wishes - this is called 
        hinting.<BR>64. &nbsp; 'Herein, what is belittling? Abusing of others, 
        disparaging, reproaching, snubbing, continual snubbing, ridicule, 
        continual ridicule, denigration, continual denigration, tale-bearing, 
        backbiting, on the part of one bent on gain, honour, and renown, of one 
        of evil wishes, a prey to wishes. This is called belittling.<BR>65. 
        &nbsp; 'Herein, what is pursuing gain with gain? Seeking, seeking for, 
        seeking out, going in search of, searching for, searching out, material 
        goods by means of material goods, such as carrying there goods that have 
        been got from here, or carrying here goods that have been got from 
        there, by one bent on gain, honour and renown, by one of evil wishes, a 
        prey to wishes - this is called pursuing gain with gain' (Vbh.352-3). <A 
        name=18txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm01.html#18fn">{18}</A> <BR>66. 
        &nbsp; The meaning of this text should be understood as follows: 
        Firstly, as regards description of <I>scheming: on the part of one bent 
        on gain, honour and renown</I> is on the part of one who is bent on 
        gain, on honour, and on reputation; on the part of one who longs for 
        them, is the meaning. [24] Of one of evil wishes: of one who wants to 
        show qualities that he has not got. <I>A prey to wishes:</I><A 
        name=19txt></A> <A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm01.html#19fn">{19}</A> the meaning 
        is, of one who is attacked by them. And after this the passage beginning 
        <I>or by what is called rejection of requisites</I> is given in order to 
        show the three instances of scheming given in the Maha-Niddesa as 
        rejection of requisites, indirect talk, and that based on 
        deportment.<BR>67. &nbsp; Herein, [a bhikkhu] is invited to accept 
        robes, etc., and, precisely because he wants them, he refuses them out 
        of evil wishes. And then, since he knows that those householders believe 
        in him implicitly, when they think 'Oh, how few are our lord's wishes! 
        He will not accept a thing! How lucky for us if he would accept just a 
        little thing!' and they put fine robes, etc., before him by various 
        means, he then accepts, making a show that he wants to be compassionate 
        towards them - it is this hypocrisy of his, which becomes the cause of 
        their subsequently bringing them even by cartloads, that should be 
        understood as the instance of scheming called rejection of requisites. 
        <BR>68. &nbsp; For this is said in the Maha-Niddesa: 'What is the 
        instance of scheming called rejection of requisites? Here householders 
        invite bhikkhus [to accept] robes, alms food, resting place, and the 
        requisite of medicine as cure for the sick. One who is of evil wishes, a 
        prey to wishes, wanting robes ... alms food ... resting place ... the 
        requisite of medicine as cure for the sick, refuses ropes ... alms food 
        ... resting place ... the requisite of medicine as cure for the sick, 
        because he wants more. He says "What has an ascetic to do with expensive 
        robes? It is proper for an ascetic to gather rags from a charnel ground 
        or from a rubbish heap or from a shop and make them into a patchwork 
        cloak to wear. What has an ascetic to do with expensive alms food? It is 
        proper for an ascetic to get his living by the dropping of lumps [of 
        food into his bowl] while he wanders for gleanings. What has an ascetic 
        to do with an expensive resting place? It is proper for an ascetic to be 
        a tree-root-dweller or an open-air-dweller. What has an ascetic to do 
        with an expensive requisite of medicine as cure for the sick? It is 
        proper for an ascetic to cure himself with putrid urine <A 
        name=20txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm01.html#20fn">{20}</A> and broken 
        gall nuts." Accordingly he wears a coarse robe, eats coarse alms food, 
        [25] uses a coarse resting place, uses a coarse requisite of medicine as 
        cure for the sick. Then householders think "This ascetic has few wishes, 
        is content, is secluded, keeps aloof from company, is strenuous, is a 
        preacher of ascetism", and they invite him more and more [to accept] 
        robes, alms food, resting places, and the requisite of medicine as cure 
        for the sick. He says "With three things present a faithful clansman 
        produces much merit: with faith present a faithful clansman produces 
        much merit, with goods to be given present a faithful clansman produces 
        much merit, with those worthy to receive present a faithful clansman 
        produces much merit. You have faith; the goods to be given are here; and 
        I am here to accept. If I do not accept then you will be deprived of the 
        merit. That is no good to me. Rather will I accept out of compassion for 
        you". Accordingly he accepts many robes, he accepts much alms food, he 
        accepts many resting places, he accepts many requisites of medicine as 
        cure for the sick. Such grimacing, grimacery, scheming, schemery, 
        schemedness, is known as the instance of scheming called rejection of 
        requisites' (Nd1,224-5).<BR>69. &nbsp; It is hypocrisy on the part of 
        one of evil wishes, who gives it to be understood verbally in some way 
        or other that he has attained a higher than human state, that should be 
        understood as the instance of scheming called indirect talk, according 
        as it is said: 'What is the instance of scheming called indirect talk? 
        Here someone of evil wishes, a prey to wishes, eager to be admired 
        [thinking] "Thus people will admire me" speaks words about the noble 
        state. He says "He who wears such a robe is a very important ascetic". 
        He says "He who carries such a bowl, metal cup, water filler, water 
        strainer, key, wears such a waistband, sandal, is a very important 
        ascetic". He says "He who has such a preceptor, ... teacher, ... who has 
        the same preceptor, who has the same teacher, who has such a friend, 
        associate, intimate, companion; he who lives in such a monastery, 
        lean-to, mansion, villa, <A name=21txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm01.html#21fn">{21}</A> cave, grotto, 
        hut, pavilion, watch tower, hall, barn, meeting hall, [26] room, at such 
        a tree root, is a very important ascetic". Or alternatively, 
        all-gushing, all-grimacing, all-scheming, all-talkative, with an 
        expression of admiration, he utters such deep, mysterious, cunning, 
        obscure, supramundane talk suggestive of voidness as "This ascetic is an 
        obtainer of peaceful abidings and attaiments such as these". Such 
        grimacing, grimacery, scheming, schemery, schemedness, is known as the 
        instance of scheming called indirect talk' (Nd1,226-7).<BR>70. &nbsp; It 
        is hypocrisy on the part of one of evil wishes, which takes the form of 
        deportment influenced by eagerness to be admired, that should be 
        understood as the instance of scheming dependent on deportment, 
        according as it is said: 'What is the instance of scheming called 
        deportment?' Here someone of evil wishes, a prey to wishes, eager to be 
        admired, [thinking] "Thus people will admire me", composes his way of 
        walking, composes his way of lying down; he walks studiedly, stands 
        studiedly, sits studiedly, lies down studiedly; he walks as though 
        concentrated, stands, sits, lies down as though concentrated; and he is 
        one who meditates in public. Such disposing, posing, composing, of 
        deportment, grimacing, grimacery, scheming, schemery, schemedness, is 
        known as the instance of scheming called deportment' (Nd1,225-6).<BR>71. 
        &nbsp; Herein, the words <I>by what is called rejection of 
        requisites</I> (&sect;61) mean: by what is called thus 'rejection of 
        requisites'; or they mean: by means of the rejection of requisites that 
        is so called. <I>By indirect talk</I> means: by talking near to the 
        subject. <I>Of deportment</I> means: of the four modes of deportment 
        (postures). <I>Disposing</I> is initial posing, or careful posing. 
        <I>Posing</I> is the manner of posing. <I>Composing</I> is prearranging; 
        assuming a trust-inspiring attitude, is what is meant. <I>Grimacing</I> 
        is making grimaces by showing great intenseness; facial contraction is 
        what is meant. One who has the habit of making grimaces is a grimacer. 
        The grimacer's state is <I>grimacery.</I> Scheming is hypocrisy. The way 
        <I>(ayana)</I> of a schemer <I>(kuha)</I> is <I>schemery (kuhayana)</I> 
        . The state of what is schemed is <I>schemednes</I> .<BR>72. &nbsp; In 
        the description of <I>talking: talking at</I> is talking thus on seeing 
        people coming to the monastery, 'What have you come for, good people? 
        What, to invite bhikkhus? If it is that, then go along and I shall come 
        later with [my bowl]', etc.; or alternatively, <I>talking at</I> is 
        talking by advertising oneself thus 'I am Tissa, the king trusts me, 
        such and such king's ministers trust me'. [27] <I>Talking</I> is the 
        same kind of talking on being asked a question. <I>Talking round</I> is 
        roundly talking by one who is afraid of householders' displeasure 
        because he has given occasion for it. <I>Talking up</I> is talking by 
        extolling people thus 'He is a great landowner, a great ship-owner, a 
        great lord of giving'. <I>Continual talking up</I> is talking by 
        extolling [people] in all ways.<BR>73. &nbsp; <I>Persuading</I> is 
        progressively involving <A name=22txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm01.html#22fn">{22}</A> [people] thus 
        'Lay followers, formerly you used to give first-fruit alms at such a 
        time; why do you not do so now?' until they say 'We shall give venerable 
        sir, we have had no opportunity', etc.; entangling, is what is meant. Or 
        alternatively, seeing someone with sugarcane in his hand, he asks 'Where 
        are you coming from, lay follower?' - 'From the sugarcane field, 
        venerable sir.' - 'Is the sugarcane sweet there?' - 'One can find out by 
        eating, venerable sir.' - 'It is not allowed, lay follower, for bhikkhus 
        to say "Give [me some] sugarcane."' Such entangling talk from such an 
        entangler is <I>persuading.</I> Persuading again and again in all ways 
        is <I>continual persuading.</I><BR>74. &nbsp; <I>Suggesting</I> is 
        insinuating by specifying thus 'That family alone understands me; if 
        there is anything to be given there, they give it to me only'; pointing 
        to, is what is meant. And here the story of the Oil-seller should be 
        told. <A name=23txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm01.html#23fn">{23}</A> Suggesting in 
        all ways again and again is <I>continual suggesting.</I><BR>75. &nbsp; 
        <I>Ingratiating chatter</I> is endearing chatter repeated again and 
        again without regard to whether it is in conformity with truth and 
        Dhamma. <I>Flattery</I> is speaking humbly, always maintaining an 
        attitude of inferiority. <I>Bean-soupery</I> is resemblance to bean 
        soup; for just as when beans are being cooked only a few do not get 
        cooked, the rest get cooked, so too the person in whose speech only a 
        little is true, the rest being false, is called a 'bean soup'; his state 
        is <I>bean-soupery.</I><BR>76. &nbsp; <I>Fondling</I> is the state of 
        the act of fondling. [28] For when a man fondles children on his lap or 
        on his shoulder like a nurse - he nurses, is the meaning -, that 
        fondler's act is the act of fondling. The state of the act of fondling 
        is <I>fondling.</I><BR>77. &nbsp; In the description of <I>hinting 
        (nemittikata):</I> a sign <I>(nimitta)</I> is any bodily or verbal act 
        that gets others to give requisites. <I>Giving a sign</I> is making a 
        sign such as 'What have you got to eat?', etc., on seeing [people] going 
        along with food. <I>Indication</I> is talk that alludes to requisites. 
        <I>Giving indication: </I>on seeing cowboys, he asks 'Are these milk 
        cows' calves or buttermilk cows' calves?', and when it is said 'They are 
        milk cows' calves, venerable sir' [he remarks] 'They are not milk cows' 
        calves. If they were milk cows' calves the bhikkhus would be getting 
        milk', etc.; and his getting it to the knowledge of the boys' parents in 
        this way, and so making them give milk, is <I>giving 
        indication'.</I><BR>78. &nbsp; <I>Indirect talk</I> is talk that keeps 
        near [to the subject]. And here there should be told the story of the 
        bhikkhu supported by a family. A bhikkhu, it seems, who was supported by 
        a family went into the house wanting to eat and sat down. The mistress 
        of the house was unwilling to give. On seeing him she said 'There is no 
        rice', and she went to a neighbour's house as though to get rice. The 
        bhikkhu went into the storeroom. Looking round, he saw sugarcane in the 
        corner behind the door, sugar in a bowl, a string of salt fish in a 
        basket, rice in a jar, and ghee in a pot. He came out and sat down. When 
        the housewife came back, she said 'I did not get any rice'. The bhikkhu 
        said 'Lay follower, I saw a sign just now that alms will not be easy to 
        get today.' - 'What, venerable sir?' - 'I saw a snake that was like 
        sugarcane put in the corner behind the door; looking for something to 
        hit it with, I saw a stone like a lump of sugar in a bowl. When the 
        snake had been hit with the clod, it spread out a hood like a string of 
        salt fish in a basket, and its teeth as it tried to bite the clod were 
        like rice grains in a jar. Then the saliva mixed with poison that came 
        out to its mouth in its fury was like ghee put in a pot.' She thought 
        'There is no hoodwinking the shaveling', so she gave him the sugarcane 
        [29] and she cooked the rice and gave it all to him with the ghee, the 
        sugar and the fish.<BR>79. &nbsp; Such talk that keeps near [to the 
        subject] should be understood as indirect talk.<BR>&nbsp; <I>Roundabout 
        talk</I> is talking round and round [the subject] as much as is 
        allowed.<BR>80. &nbsp; In the description of <I>belittling: abusing</I> 
        is abusing by means of the ten instances of abuse. <A name=24txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm01.html#24fn">{24}</A> 
        <I>Disparaging</I> is contemptuous talk. <I>Reproaching</I> is 
        enumeration of faults such as 'He is faithless, he is an unbeliever'. 
        <I>Snubbing</I> is taking up verbally thus 'Don't say that here'. 
        Snubbing in all ways, giving grounds and reason, is <I>continual 
        snubbing.</I> Or alternatively, when someone does not give, taking him 
        up thus 'Oh, the prince of givers!' is <I>snubbing;</I> and the thorough 
        snubbing thus 'A mighty prince of givers!' is <I>continual snubbing. 
        Ridicule</I> is making fun of someone thus 'What sort of a life has this 
        man who eats up his seed [grain]?'. <I>Continual ridicule</I> is making 
        fun of him more thoroughly thus 'What, you say this man is not a giver 
        who always gives the words "There is<BR>81. nothing" to everyone?'. 
        <I>Denigration</I><A name=25txt></A> <A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm01.html#25fn">{25}</A> is 
        denigrating someone by saying that he is not a giver, or by censuring 
        him. All round denigration is <I>continual denigration. Tale-bearing</I> 
        is bearing tales from house to house, from village to village, from 
        district to district, [thinking] 'So they will give to me out of fear of 
        my bearing tales'. <I>Backbiting</I> is speaking censoriously behind 
        another's back after speaking kindly to his face; for this is like 
        biting the flesh of another's back, when he is not looking, on the part 
        of one who is unable to look him in the face; therefore it is called 
        <I>backbiting. This is called belittling (nippesikata)</I> because it 
        scrapes off {25} <I>(nippeseti),</I> wipes off, {25} the virtuous 
        qualities of others as a bamboo scraper {25} <I>(velupesika)</I> does 
        unguent, {25} or because it is a pursuit of gain by grinding {25} 
        <I>(nippimsitva)</I> and pulverizing others' virtuous qualities, like 
        the pursuit of perfume by grinding the kinds of perfumed substances; 
        that is why it is called <I>belittling.</I><BR>82. &nbsp; In the 
        description of <I>pursuing gain with gain: pursuing</I> is hunting 
        after. <I>Got from here</I> is got from this house. <I>There</I> is into 
        that house. <I>Seeking</I> is wanting. <I>Seeking for</I> is hunting 
        after. <I>Seeking out</I> is hunting after again and again. [30] The 
        story of the bhikkhu who went round giving away the alms he had got at 
        first to children of families here and there and in the end got milk and 
        gruel should be told here. <I>Searching,</I> etc., are synonyms for 
        'seeking' etc., and so the construction here should be understood thus: 
        <I>going in search of</I> is seeking; <I>searching for</I> is seeking 
        for; <I>searching out</I> is seeking out.<BR>This is the meaning of 
        <I>scheming,</I> and so on.<BR>83. &nbsp; Now [as regards the words] 
        <I>The evil states beginning with</I> (&sect;42): here the words <I>beginning 
        with</I> should be understood to include the many evil states given in 
        the Brahmajala Sutta in the way beginning 'Or just as some worthy 
        ascetics, while eating the food given by the faithful, make a living by 
        wrong livelihood by such low arts as these, that is to say, by 
        palmistry, by forfune-telling, by divining omens, by interpreting 
        dreams, marks on the body, holes gnawed by mice; by fire sacrifice, by 
        spoon oblation, ...' (D.i,9).<BR>84. &nbsp; So this wrong livelihood 
        entails the transgression of these six training precepts announced on 
        account of livelihood, and it entails the evil states beginning with 
        'Scheming, talking, hinting, belittling, pursuing gain with gain'. And 
        so it is the abstinence from all sorts of wrong livelihood that is 
        <I>virtue of livelihood purification,</I> the word-meaning of which is 
        this: on account of it they live, thus it is livelihood. What is that? 
        It is the effort consisting in the search for requisites. 'Purification' 
        is purifiedness. 'Livelihood purification' is purification of 
        livelihood.<BR>85. &nbsp; <I>(d)</I> As regards the next kind called 
        <I>virtue concerning requisites,</I> [here is the text: 'Reflecting 
        wisely, he uses the robe only for protection from cold, for protection 
        from heat, for protection from contact with gadflies, flies, wind, 
        burning, and creeping things, and only for the purpose of concealing the 
        private parts. Reflecting wisely, he uses alms food neither for 
        amusement nor for intoxication nor for smartening nor for embellishment, 
        but only for the endurance and continuance of this body, for the ending 
        of discomfort, and for assisting the life of purity: "Thus I shall put a 
        stop to old feelings and shall not arouse new feelings, and I shall be 
        healthy and blameless and live in comfort." Reflecting wisely, he uses 
        the resting place only for the purpose of protection from cold, for 
        protection from heat, for protection from contact with gadflies, flies, 
        wind, burning and creeping things, and only for the purpose of warding 
        off the perils of climate and enjoying retreat. Reflecting wisely, he 
        uses the requisite of medicine as cure for the sick only for protection 
        from arisen hurtful feelings and for complete immunity from affliction' 
        (M.i,10).] Herein <I>reflecting wisely</I> is reflecting as the means 
        and as the way; <A name=26txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm01.html#26fn">{26}</A> by knowing, 
        by reviewing, is the meaning. And here it is the reviewing stated in the 
        way beginning 'For protection from cold' that should be understood as 
        'reflecting wisely'.<BR>86. &nbsp; Herein, <I>The robe</I> is any one of 
        those beginning with the inner cloth. <I>He uses:</I> he employs; 
        dresses in [as inner cloth], or puts on [as upper garment]. <I>Only</I> 
        [31] is a phrase signifying invariability in the definition of a limit 
        <A name=27txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm01.html#27fn">{27}</A> of a purpose; 
        the purpose in the meditator's making use of the robes is that much 
        only, namely, protection from cold, etc., not more than that. <I>From 
        cold:</I> from any kind of cold arisen either through disturbance of 
        elements internally or through change in temperature externally. <I>For 
        protection:</I> for the purpose of warding off; for the purpose of 
        eliminating it so that it may not arouse affliction in the body. For 
        when the body is afflicted by cold, the distracted mind cannot be wisely 
        exerted. That is why the Blessed One purmitted the robe to be used for 
        protection from cold. So in each instance. Except that <I>from heat</I> 
        means from the heat of fire, the origin of which should be understood as 
        forest fires, and so on.<BR>87. &nbsp; <I>From contact with gadflies and 
        flies, wind and burning and creeping things:</I> here <I>gadflies</I> 
        are flies that bite; they are also called 'blind flies'. <I>Flies</I> 
        are just flies. <I>Wind</I> is distinguished as that with dust and that 
        without dust. <I>Burning</I> is burning of the sun. <I>Creeping 
        things</I> are any long creatures such as snakes and so on that move by 
        crawling. Contact with them is of two kinds: contact by being bitten and 
        contact by being touched. And that does not worry him who sits with a 
        robe on. So he uses it for the purpose of protection from such things. 
        <BR>88. &nbsp; <I>Only:</I> the word is repeated in order to define 
        subdivision of the invariable purpose; for the concealment of the 
        private parts is an invariable purpose; the others are purposes 
        periodically. Herein, <I>private parts</I> are any parts of the 
        pudendum. For when a member is disclosed, conscience <I>(hiri)</I> is 
        disturbed <I>(kuppati),</I> offended. It is called 'private parts 
        <I>(hirikopina)'</I> because of the disturbance of conscience 
        <I>(hiri-kopana). For the purpose of concealing the private parts:</I> 
        for the purpose of the concealment of those private parts. [As well as 
        the reading <I>hirikopinapaticchadanattham']</I> there is a reading 
        <I>'hirikopinam paticchadanattham'.</I><BR>89. &nbsp; <I>Alms food</I> 
        is any sort of food. For any sort of nutriment is called alms food 
        <I>(pindapata</I> - lit. lump-dropping)' because of its having been 
        dropped <I>(patitatta)</I> into a bhikkhu's bowl during his alms round 
        <I>(pindolya).</I> Or alms food <I>(pindapata)</I> is the dropping 
        <I>(pata)</I> of the lumps <I>(pinda);</I> it is the concurrence 
        <I>(sannipata),</I> the collection, of alms <I>(bhikkha)</I> obtained 
        here and there, is what is meant. &nbsp;Neither for amusement: neither 
        for the purpose of amusement, as with village boys, etc.; for sake of 
        sport, is what is meant. <I>Nor for intoxication:</I> not for the 
        purpose of intoxication, as with boxers, etc.; for the sake of 
        intoxication with strength and for the sake of intoxication with 
        manhood, is what is meant. [32] <I>Nor for smartening:</I> not for the 
        purpose of smartening, as with royal concubines, courtesans, etc.; for 
        the sake of plumpness in all the limbs, is what is meant. <I>Nor for 
        embellishment:</I> not for the purpose of embellishment, as with actors, 
        dancers, etc.; for the sake of a clear skin and complexion, is what is 
        meant.<BR>90. &nbsp; And here the clause <I>neither for amusement</I> is 
        stated for the purpose of abandoning support for delusion; <I>nor for 
        intoxication</I> is said for the purpose of abandoning support for hate; 
        <I>nor for smartening nor for embellishment</I> is said for the purpose 
        of abandoning support for greed. And <I>neither for amusement nor for 
        intoxicetion</I> is said for the purpose of preventing the arising of 
        fetters for oneself. <I>Nor for smartening nor for embellishment</I> is 
        said for the purpose of preventing the arising of fetters for another. 
        And the abandoning of both unwise practice and devotion to indulgence of 
        sense pleasures should be understood as stated by these four. 
        <I>Only</I> has the meaning already stated.<BR>91. &nbsp; <I>Of this 
        body:</I> of this material body consisting of the four great primaries. 
        <I>For the endurance:</I> for the purpose of continued endurance. <I>And 
        continuance:</I> for the purpose of not interrupting [life's continued] 
        occurrence, or for the purpose of endurance for a long time. He makes 
        use of the alms food for the purpose of the endurance, for the purpose 
        of the continuance of the body, as the owner of an old house uses props 
        for his house, and as a carter uses axle grease, not for the purpose of 
        amusement, intoxication, smartening; and embellishment. Furthermore, 
        endurance is a term for the life faculty. So what has been said as far 
        as the words <I>for the endurance and continuance of this body</I> can 
        be understood to mean: for the purpose of maintaining the occurrence of 
        the life faculty in this body.<BR>92. &nbsp; <I>For the ending of 
        discomfort:</I> hunger is called 'discomfort' in the sense of 
        afflicting. He makes use of alms food for the purpose of ending that, 
        like annointing a wound, like counteracting heat with cold, and so on. 
        <I>For assisting the life of purity:</I> for the purpose of assisting 
        the life of purity consisting in the whole dispensation and the life of 
        purity consisting in the path. For while this [bhikkhu] is engaged in 
        crossing the desert of existence by means of devotion to the Three 
        Trainings depending on bodily strength whose necessary condition is the 
        use of alms food, he makes use of it to assist the life of purity just 
        as those seeking to cross the desert used their child's flesh, <A 
        name=28txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm01.html#28fn">{28}</A> just as those 
        seeking to cross a river use a raft, and just as those seeking to cross 
        the ocean use a ship.<BR>93. &nbsp; <I>Thus I shall put a stop to old 
        feelings and shall not arouse new feelings:</I> [33] thus as a sick man 
        uses medicine, he uses [alms food, thinking]: 'by use of this alms food 
        I shall put a stop to the old feeling of hunger, and I shall not arouse 
        a new feeling by immoderate eating, like one of the [proverbial] 
        brahmans, that is, one who eats till he has to be helped up by hand, or 
        till his clothes will not meet, or till he rolls there [on the ground], 
        or till crows can peck from his mouth, or till he vomits what he has 
        eaten. Or alternatively, there is that which is called "old feelings" 
        because, being conditioned by former kamma, it arises now in dependence 
        on unsuitable immoderate eating - I shall put a stop to that old 
        feeling, forestalling its condition by suitable moderate eating. And 
        there is that which is called "new feeling" because it will arise in the 
        future in dependence on the accumulation of kamma consisting in making 
        improper use [of the requisite of alms food] now - I shall also not 
        arouse that new feeling, avoiding by means of proper use the production 
        of its root'. This is how the meaning should be understood here. What 
        has been shown so far can be understood to include proper use [of 
        requisites], abandoning of devotion to self-mortification, and not 
        giving up lawful bliss (pleasure).<BR>94. &nbsp; <I>And I shall be 
        healthy:</I> 'In this body, which exists in dependence on requisites, I 
        shall, by moderate eating, have health called "long endurance" since 
        there will be no danger of severing the life faculty or interrupting the 
        [continuity of the] postures'. [Reflecting] in this way, he makes use 
        [of the alms food] as a sufferer from a chronic disease does his 
        medicine. <I>And blameless and live in comfort</I> (lit. and have 
        blamelessness and a comfortable abiding): he makes use of them thinking 
        'I shall have blamelessness by avoiding improper search, acceptance and 
        eating, and I shall have a comfortable abiding by moderate eating'. Or 
        he does so thinking 'I shall have blamelessness due to absence of such 
        faults as boredom, sloth, sleepiness, blame by the wise, etc., that have 
        unseemly immoderate eating as their condition; and I shall have a 
        comfortable abiding by producing bodily strength that has seemly 
        moderate eating as its condition'. Or he does so thinking 'I shall have 
        blamelessness by abandoning the pleasure of lying down, lolling and 
        torpor through refraining from eating as much as possible to stuff the 
        belly; and I shall have a comfortable abiding by controlling the four 
        postures through eating four or five mouthfuls less than the maximum'. 
        For this is said:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'With four or five lumps still to 
        eat,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let him 
        then end by drinking water;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For energetic bhikkhus' needs<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This should suffice to live in 
        comfort'. (Thag.983) <A name=29txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm01.html#29fn">{29}</A> [34]<BR>Now 
        what has been shown at this point can be understood as discernment of 
        purpose and practice of the middle way.<BR>95. &nbsp; <I>Resting Place 
        (senasana):</I> this is the bed <I>(sena)</I> and seat <I>(asana).</I> 
        For wherever one sleeps <I>(seti),</I> whether in a monastery or in a 
        lean-to, etc., that is the bed (sena); wherever one seats oneself 
        <I>(asati),</I> sits <I>(nisidati),</I> that is the seat <I>(asana).</I> 
        Both together are called 'resting-place (or abode - 
        <I>senasana)'.</I><BR>&nbsp; <I>For the purppse of warding off the 
        perils of climate and enjoying retreat:</I> the climate itself in the 
        sense of imperilling <I>(parisahana)</I> is 'perils of climate 
        <I>(utu-parissaya)'.</I> Unsuitable climatic conditions that cause 
        mental distraction due to bodily affliction can be warded off by making 
        use of the resting place; it is for the purpose of warding off these and 
        for the purpose of the pleasure of solitude, is what is meant. Of 
        course, the warding off of the perils of climate is stated by [the 
        phrase] 'protection from cold', etc., too; but, just as in the case of 
        making use of the robes the concealment of the private parts is stated 
        as an invariable purpose while the others are periodical [purposes], so 
        here also this [last] should be understood as mentioned with reference 
        to the invariable warding off of the perils of climate. Or 
        alternatively; this 'climate' of the kind stated is just climate; but 
        'perils' are of two kinds: evident perils and concealed perils (see 
        Nd1.12). Herein, evident perils are lions, tigers, etc., while concealed 
        perils are greed, hate, and so on. When a bhikkhu knows and reflects 
        thus in making use of the kind of resting place where these [perils] do 
        not, owing to 'unguarded doors and sight of unsuitable visible objects, 
        etc., cause affliction, he can be understood as one who 'reflecting 
        wisely makes use of the resting place for the purpose of warding off the 
        perils of climate'.<BR>96. &nbsp; <I>The requisite of medicine as cure 
        for the sick:</I> here 'cure <I>(paccaya</I> = going against)' is in the 
        sense of going against <I>(pati-ayana)</I> illness; in the sense of 
        countering, is the meaning. This is a term for any suitable remedy. It 
        is the medical man's work <I>(bhisakassa kammam)</I> because it is 
        permitted by him, thus it is medicine <I>(bhesajja).</I> Or the cure for 
        the sick itself as medicine is 'medicine as cure for the sick'. Any work 
        of a medical man such as oil, honey, ghee, etc., that is suitable for 
        one who is sick, is what is meant. A 'requisite <I>(parikkhara)',</I> 
        however, in such passages as 'It is well supplied with the requisites of 
        a city' (A.iv,106) is equipment; in such passages as 'The chariot has 
        the requisite of virtue, the axle of jhana, the wheel of energy' (S.v,6) 
        [35] it is an ornament; in such passages as 'The requisites for the life 
        of one who has gone into homelessness that should be available' 
        (M.i,104) it is an accessory. But here both equipment and accessory are 
        applicable. For that medicine as a cure for the sick is equipment for 
        maintaining life because it protects by preventing the arising of 
        affliction destructive to life; and it is an accessory too because it is 
        an instrument for prolonging life. That is why it is called 'requisite'. 
        So it is medicine as cure for the sick and that is requisite, thus it is 
        a 'requisite of medicine as cure for the sick'. [He makes use of] that 
        requisite of medicine as cure for the sick; any requisite for life 
        consisting of oil, honey, molasses, ghee, etc., that is allowed by a 
        medical man as suitable for the sick, is what is meant.<BR>97. &nbsp; 
        <I>From arisen:</I> from born, become produced. <I>Hurtful:</I> here 
        'hurt (affliction)' is a disturbance of elements, and it is the leprosy, 
        tumours, boils, etc., originated by that disturbance. <I>Hurtful 
        (veyyabadhika)</I> because arisen in the form of hurt <I>(byabadha). 
        Feelings:</I> painful feelings, feelings resulting from unprofitable 
        kamma - from those hurtful feelings. <I>For complete immunity from 
        affliction:</I> for complete freedom from pain; so that all that is 
        painful is abandoned, is the meaning.<BR>&nbsp; This is how this 
        <I>virtue concerning requisites</I> should be understood. In brief its 
        characteristic is the use of requisites after wise reflection. The 
        word-meaning here is this: because breathing things go <I>(ayanti),</I> 
        move, proceed, using [what they use] in dependence on these robes, etc., 
        these robes, etc., are therefore called requisites <I>(paccaya</I> = 
        ger. of <I>pati + ayati);</I> 'concerning requisites' is concerning 
        those requisites.<BR>98. &nbsp; <I>(a)</I> So, in this fourfold virtue, 
        <I>Patimokkha restraint</I> has to be undertaken by means of 
        <I>faith.</I> For that is accomplished by faith, since the announcing of 
        training precepts is outside the disciples' province; and the evidence 
        here is the refusal of the request to [allow disciples to] announce 
        training precepts (See Vin.iii,9-10). Having therefore undertaken 
        through faith the training precepts without exception as announced, one 
        should completely perfect them without regard for life. For this is 
        said: [36]<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        'As a hen guards her eggs,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or as a yak her tail,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or like a darling 
        child,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or 
        like an only eye,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So you who are engaged<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your virtue to 
        protect,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be 
        prudent at all times<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And ever scrupulous' ( &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp; ). <BR>Also it is said further 'So too, Sire, when a training 
        precept for disciples is announced by me, my disciples do not transgress 
        it even for the sake of life' (A.iv,201).<BR>99. &nbsp; And the story of 
        the Elders bound by robbers in the forest should be understood in this 
        sense.<BR>&nbsp; It seems that robbers in the Mahavattani Forest bound 
        an Elder with black creepers and made him lie down. While he lay there 
        for seven days he augmented his insight, and after reaching the fruition 
        of Non-return, he died there and was reborn in the Brahma 
        World.<BR>&nbsp; Also they bound another Elder in Tambapanni Island 
        (Ceylon) with string creepers and made him lie down. When a forest fire 
        came and the creepers were not cut, he established insight and attained 
        nibbana simultaneously with his death. When the Elder Abhaya, a preacher 
        of the Digha Nikaya, passed by with five hundred bhikkhus, he saw [what 
        had happened] and he had the Elder's body cremated and a shrine built. 
        Therefore let other clansmen also<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maintain the Rules of Conduct 
        pure,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Renouncing life if there be need,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rather than break virtue's 
        restraint<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By 
        the World's Saviour decreed.<BR>100. &nbsp; <I>(b)</I> And as Patimokkha 
        restraint is undertaken out of faith, so <I>restraint of the sense 
        faculties </I>should be undertaken with <I>mindfulness.</I> For that is 
        accomplished by mindfulness, because when the sense faculties' functions 
        are founded on mindfulness, there is no liability to invasion by 
        covetousness and the rest. So, recollecting the Fire Discourse, which 
        begins thus, 'Better, bhikkhus, the extirpation of the eye faculty by a 
        red-hot burning blazing glowing iron spike than the apprehension of 
        signs in the particulars of visible objects 'cognizable by the eye' 
        (S.iv,168), this [restraint] should be properly undertaken by preventing 
        with unremitting mindfulness any apprehension, in the objective fields 
        consisting of visible data, etc., of any signs, etc., likely to 
        encourage covetousness, etc., to invade consciousness occurring in 
        connexion with the eye door and so on.<BR>101. &nbsp; [37] When not 
        undertaken thus, virtue of Patimokkha restraint is unenduring: it does 
        not last, like a crop not fenced in with branches. And it is raided by 
        the robber defilements as a village with open gates is by thieves. And 
        lust, leaks into his mind as rain does into a badly-roofed house. For 
        this is said:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Among the visible objects, sounds, and 
        smells,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And 
        tastes, and tangibles, guard the faculties;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For when these doors are open and 
        unguarded,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Then thieves will come and raid as 'twere a 
        village'<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ( &nbsp; &nbsp; 
        &nbsp; &nbsp;).<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And just as with an ill-roofed 
        house<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
        rain comes leaking in, so too<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will lust come leaking in for 
        sure<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon an 
        undeveloped mind' (Dh.13).<BR>102. &nbsp; When it is undertaken thus, 
        virtue of Patimokkha restraint is enduring: it lasts, like a crop well 
        fenced in with branches. And it is not raided by the robber defilements, 
        as a village with well-guarded gates is not by thieves. And lust does 
        not leak into his mind, as rain does not into a well-roofed house. For 
        this is said:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Among the visible objects, sounds and 
        smells,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And 
        tastes and tangibles, guard the faculties;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For when these doors are closed 
        and truly guarded,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thieves will not come and raid as 'twere a 
        village'<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ( &nbsp; &nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp; ).<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And just as with a well-roofed 
        house<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No 
        rain comes leaking in, so too<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No lust comes leaking in for 
        sure<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon a 
        well-developed mind' (Dh.14).<BR>103. &nbsp; This, however, is the 
        teaching at its very highest.<BR>&nbsp; This mind is called 'quickly 
        transformed' (A.1,10), so restraint of the faculties should be 
        undertaken by removing arisen lust with the contemplation of foulness, 
        as was done by the Elder Vangisa soon after he had gone forth. 
        [38]<BR>&nbsp; As the Elder was wandering for alms, it seems, soon after 
        going forth, lust arose in him on seeing a woman. Thereupon he said to 
        the venerable Ananda:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am afire with sensual lust.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And burning flames consume my 
        mind;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 
        pity tell me, Gotama,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to extinguish it for good' (S.i,188).<BR>The 
        Elder said:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        'You do perceive mistakenly,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That burning flames consume your 
        mind.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look 
        for no sign of beauty there,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For that it is which leads to 
        lust.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See 
        foulness there and keep your mind<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harmoniously 
        concentrated;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Formations see as alien,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As ill, not self, so this great 
        lust<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May be 
        extinguished, and no more<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take fire thus ever and again' (S.i,188).<BR>The 
        Elder expelled his lust and then went on with his alms round.<BR>104. 
        &nbsp; Moreover a bhikkhu who is fulfilling restraint of the faculties 
        should be like the elder Cittagutta resident in the Great Cave at 
        Kurandaka, and like the Elder Maha-Mitta resident at the Great Monastery 
        of Coraka.<BR>105. &nbsp; In the Great Cave of Kurandaka, it seems, 
        there was a lovely painting of the Renunciation of the Seven Buddhas. A 
        number of Bhikkhus wandering about among the dwellings saw the painting 
        and said 'What a lovely painting, venerable sir!'. The Elder said 'For 
        more than sixty years, friends, I have lived in the cave, and I did not 
        know whether there was any painting there or not. Now, today, I know it 
        through those who have eyes'. The Elder, it seems, though he had lived 
        there for so long, had never raised his eyes and looked up at the cave. 
        And at the door of his cave there was a great ironwood tree. And the 
        Elder had never looked up at that either. He knew it was in flower when 
        he saw its petals on the ground each year.<BR>106. &nbsp; The king heard 
        of the Elder's great virtues, and he sent for him three times, desiring 
        to pay homage to him. When the Elder did not go, he had the breasts of 
        all the women with infants in the town bound and sealed off, [saying], 
        'As long as the Elder does not come let the children go without milk'. 
        [39] 0ut of compassion for the children the Elder went to Mahagama. When 
        the king heard [that he had come, he said] 'Go and bring the Elder in. I 
        shall take the Precepts'. Having had him brought up into the inner 
        palace, he paid homage to him and provided him with a meal. Then, saying 
        'Today, venerable sir, there is no opportunity. I shall take the 
        Precepts tomorrow', he took the Elder's bowl. After following him for a 
        little, he paid homage with the queen and turned back. As seven days 
        went by thus, whether it was the king who paid homage or whether it was 
        the queen, the Elder said 'May the king be happy'.<BR>107. &nbsp; 
        Bhikkhus asked 'Why is it, venerable sir, that whether it is the king 
        who pays the homage or the queen you say "May the king be happy"?'. The 
        Elder replied 'Friends, I do not notice whether it is the king or the 
        queen'. At the end of seven days (when it was found that] the Elder was 
        not happy living there, he was dismissed by the king. He went back to 
        the Great Cave at Kurandaka. When it was night he went out onto his 
        walk. A deity who dwelt in the ironwood tree stood by with a torch of 
        sticks. Then his meditation subject became quite clear and plain. The 
        Elder, (thinking] 'How clear my meditation subject is today!', was glad, 
        and immediately after the middle watch he reached Arahantship, making 
        the whole rock resound. <A name=30txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm01.html#30fn">{30}</A> <BR>108. 
        &nbsp; So when another clansman seeks his own 
        good,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let 
        him not be hungry-eyed,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a monkey in the groves,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a wild deer in the 
        woods,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like 
        a nervous little child,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let him go with eyes downcast<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing a plough yoke's length 
        before,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That 
        he fall not in the power<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the forest-monkey mind.<BR>109. &nbsp; The Elder 
        Maha-Mitta's mother was sick with a poisoned tumour. She told her 
        daughter, who as a bhikkhuni had also gone forth, 'Lady, go to your 
        brother. Tell him my trouble and bring back some medicine'. She went and 
        told him. The Elder said 'I do not know how to gather root medicines and 
        such things and concoct a medicine from them. But rather I will tell you 
        a medicine: since I went forth I have not broken [my virtue of restraint 
        of] the sense faculties by looking at the bodily form of the opposite 
        sex with a lustful mind. By this [40] declaration of truth may my mother 
        get well. Go and tell the lay devotee and rub her body'. She went and 
        told her what had happened and then did as she had been instructed. At 
        that very moment the lay devotee's tumour vanished, shrinking away like 
        a lump of froth. She got up and uttered a cry of joy: 'If the Fully 
        Enlightened One were still alive, why should he not stroke with his 
        net-adorned hand the head of a bhikkhu like my son?'. So<BR>110. 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Let another noble 
        clansman<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Gone forth in the Dispensation<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep, as did the Elder Mitta,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perfect faculty restraint.<BR>111. 
        &nbsp; <I>(c)</I> As restraint of the faculties is to be undertaken by 
        means of mindfulness, so <I>Livelihood purification</I> is to be 
        undertaken by means of energy. For that is accomplished by energy, 
        because the abandoning of wrong livelihood is effected in one who has 
        rightly applied energy. Abandoning, therefore, unbefitting wrong search, 
        this should be undertaken with energy by means of the right kind of 
        search consisting in going on alms round, etc., avoiding what is of 
        impure origin as though it were a poisonous snake, and using only 
        requisites of pure origin.<BR>112. &nbsp; Herein, for one who has not 
        taken up the Ascetic Practices any requisites obtained from the 
        Community, from a group of bhikkhus, or from laymen who have confidence 
        in his special qualities of teaching the Dhamma, etc. are called 'of 
        pure origin'. But those obtained on alms round, etc., are of extremely 
        pure origin. For one who has taken up the Ascetic Practices those 
        obtained on alms round, etc. and - as long as this is in accordance with 
        the rules of the ascetic practices - from people who have confidence in 
        his special qualities of ascetism, are called 'of pure origin'. And if 
        he has got putrid urine with mixed gall nuts and 'four sweets' <A 
        name=31txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm01.html#31fn">{31}</A> for the 
        purpose of curing a certain affliction, and he eats only the broken gall 
        nuts, thinking 'Other companions in the life of purity will eat the 
        "four-sweets"', his undertaking of the ascetic practices is befitting, 
        for he is then called a bhikkhu who is supreme in the Noble Ones' 
        Heritages (See A.ii,28).<BR>113. &nbsp; As to the robe and the other 
        requisites, no hint, indication, roundabout talk, or intimation, about 
        robes and alms food is allowable for a bhikkhu who is purifying his 
        livelihood. But a hint, indication, or roundabout talk, about a resting 
        place is allowable for one who has not taken up the ascetic practices. 
        [41].<BR>114. &nbsp; Herein, a 'hint' is when one who is getting the 
        preparing of the ground, etc., done for the purpose of [making] a 
        resting place is asked 'What is being done, venerable sir? Who is having 
        it done?' and he replies 'No one'; or any other such giving of hints. An 
        'indication' is saying 'Lay follower, where do you live?' - 'In a 
        mansion, venerable sir,' - 'But, lay follower, a mansion is not allowed 
        for bhikkhus.' Or any other such giving of indication. 'Roundabout talk' 
        is saying 'The resting place for the Community of Bhikkhus is crowded'; 
        or any other such oblique talk.<BR>115. &nbsp; All, however, is allowed 
        in the case of medicine. But when the disease is cured, is it or is it 
        not allowed to use the medicine obtained in this way? Herein, the Vinaya 
        specialists say that the opening has been given by the Blessed One, 
        therefore it is allowable. But the Suttanta specialists say that though 
        there is no offence, nevertheless the livelihood<BR>116. is sullied, 
        therefore it is not allowable. But one who does not use hints, 
        indications, roundabout talk, or intimation, though these are permitted 
        by the Blessed One, and who depends only on the special qualities of 
        fewness of wishes, etc., and makes use only of requisites obtained 
        otherwise than by indication, etc., even when he thus risks his life, is 
        called supreme in living in effacement, like the venerable 
        Sariputta.<BR>117. &nbsp; It seems that the venerable one was 
        cultivating seclusion at one time, living in a certain forest with the 
        Elder Maha-Moggallana. One day an affliction of colic arose in him, 
        causing him great pain. In the evening the Elder Maha-Moggallana went to 
        attend upon him. Seeing him lying down, he asked what the reason was. 
        And then he asked 'What used to make you better formerly, friend?'. The 
        Elder said 'When I was a layman, friend, my mother used to mix ghee, 
        honey, sugar and so on, and give me rice gruel with pure milk. That used 
        to make me better'. Then the other said 'So be it, friend. If either you 
        or I have merit, perhaps<BR>118. tomorrow we shall get some'. Now a 
        deity who dwelt in a tree at the end of the walk overheard their 
        conversation. [Thinking] 'I will find rice gruel for the lord tomorrow', 
        he went meanwhile to the family who was supporting the Elder [42] and 
        entered into the body of the eldest son, causing him discomfort. Then he 
        told the assembled relatives the price of the cure: 'If you prepare rice 
        gruel of such a kind tomorrow for the Elder, I will set this one free'. 
        They said 'Even without being told by you we regularly supply the 
        Elder's needs', and on the following day they prepared rice gruel of the 
        kind needed.<BR>119. &nbsp; The Elder Maha-Moggallana came in the 
        morning and said 'Stay here, friend, till I come back from the alms 
        round'. Then he went into the village. Those people met him. They took 
        his bowl, filled it with the stipulated kind of rice gruel, and gave it 
        back to him. The Elder made as though to go, but they said 'Eat, 
        venerable sir, We shall give you more'. When the Elder had eaten, they 
        gave him another bowlful. The Elder left. Bringing the alms food to the 
        venerable Sariputta, he said 'Here, friend Sariputta, eat,'. When the 
        Elder saw it, he thought 'The gruel is very nice. How was it got?', and 
        seeing how it had been obtained, he said 'Friend, the alms food cannot 
        be used'.<BR>120. &nbsp; Instead of thinking 'He does not eat alms food 
        brought by the likes of me', the other at once took the bowl by the rim 
        and turned it over on one side. As the rice gruel fell on the ground the 
        Elder's affliction vanished. From then on it did not appear again during 
        forty-five years.<BR>121. &nbsp; Then he said to the venerable 
        Maha-Moggallana 'Friend, even if one's bowels come out and trail on the 
        ground, it is not fitting to eat gruel got by verbal intimation', and he 
        uttered this exclamation:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp; 'My livelihood might well be blamed,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I were to consent to 
        eat<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
        honey and the gruel obtained<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By influence of verbal hints.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And even if my bowels 
        obtrude<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And 
        trail outside, and even though<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My life is to be jeopardized,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will not blot my livelihood 
        (Miln.370).<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        For I will satisfy my heart<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By shunning all wrong kinds of 
        search;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And 
        never will I undertake<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The search the Buddhas have condemned' ( &nbsp; 
        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; ). [43]<BR>122. &nbsp; And here too should be told 
        the story of the Elder Maha-Tissa the Mango-eater who lived at Ciragumba 
        (see &sect;132 below). <A name=32txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm01.html#32fn">{32}</A> So in all 
        respects<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 
        man who has gone forth in faith<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should purify his livelihood<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, seeing clearly, give no 
        thought<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To 
        any search that is not good.<BR>123. &nbsp; <I>(d)</I> And, as 
        livelihood purification is to be undertaken by means of energy, so 
        <I>virtue dependent on requisites</I> is to be undertaken by means of 
        <I>understanding.</I> For that is accomplished by understanding, because 
        one who possesses understanding is able to see the advantages and the 
        dangers in requisites. So one should abandon greed for requisites and 
        undertake that virtue by using requisites obtained lawfully and 
        properly, after reviewing them with understanding in the way 
        aforesaid.<BR>124. &nbsp; Herein, reviewing is of two kinds: at the time 
        of receiving requisites,and at the time of using them. For use is 
        blameless in one, who at the time of receiving robes, etc., reviews them 
        either as [mere] elements or as repulsive, <A name=33txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm01.html#33fn">{33}</A> and puts them 
        aside for later use, and in one who reviews them thus at the time of 
        using them.<BR>125. &nbsp; Here is an explanation to settle the matter. 
        There are four kinds of use: use as theft, <A name=34txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm01.html#34fn">{34}</A> use as debt, 
        use as an inheritance, use as a master. Herein, use by one who is 
        unvirtuous and makes use [of requisites], even sitting in the midst of 
        the community; is called 'use as theft'. Use without reviewing by one 
        who is virtuous is 'use as a debt'; therefore the robe should be 
        reviewed every time it is used, and the alms food lump by lump. One who 
        cannot do this [should review it] before the meal, after the meal, in 
        the first watch, in the middle watch, and in the last watch. If dawn 
        breaks on him without his having reviewed it, he finds himself in the 
        position of one who has used it as a debt. Also the resting place should 
        be reviewed each time it is used. Recourse to mindfulness both in the 
        accepting and the use of medicine is proper; but while this is so, 
        though there is an offence for one who uses it without mindfulness after 
        mindful acceptance, there is no offence for one who is mindful in using 
        after accepting without mindfulness.<BR>126. &nbsp; Purification is of 
        four kinds: purification by the Teaching, purification by restraint, 
        purification by search, and purification by reviewing. Herein, <I>virtue 
        of the Patimokkha restraint</I> is called 'purification by the 
        Teaching'; [44] for that is so called because it purifies by means of 
        teaching. <I>Virtue of restraint of faculties</I> is called 
        'purification by restraint'; for that is so called because it purifies 
        by means of the restraint in the mental resolution 'I shall not do so 
        again'. <I>Virtue of livelihood purification</I> is called 'purification 
        by search'; for that is so called because search is purified in one who 
        abandons wrong search and gets requisites lawfully and properly. 
        <I>Virtue dependent on requisites</I> is called 'purification by 
        reviewing'; for that is so called because it purifies by the reviewing 
        of the kind already described. Hence it was said above (&sect;125) 'There is 
        no offence for one who is mindful in using after accepting without 
        mindfulness'.<BR>127. &nbsp; Use of the requisites by the seven kinds of 
        Trainers is called 'use as an inheritance'; For they are the Buddha's 
        sons, therefore they make use of the requisites as the heirs or 
        requisites belonging to their father. But how then, is it the Blessed 
        One's requisites or the laity's requisites that are used? Although given 
        by the laity, they actually belong to the Blessed One, because it is by 
        the Blessed One that they are permitted. That is why it should be 
        understood that the Blessed One's requisites are used. The confirmation 
        here is in the Dhammadayada Sutta (M. Sutta 3).<BR>&nbsp; Use by those 
        whose cankers are destroyed is called 'use as a master'; for they make 
        use of them as masters because they have escaped the slavery of 
        craving.<BR>128. &nbsp; As regards these kinds of use, use as a master 
        and use as an inheritance are allowable for all. Use as a debt is not 
        allowable, to say nothing of use as theft. But this use of what is 
        reviewed by one who is virtuous is use freed from debt because it is the 
        opposite of use as a debt or is included in use as an inheritance too. 
        For one possessed of virtue is called a Trainer too because of 
        possessing this training.<BR>129. &nbsp; As regards these three kinds of 
        use, since use as a master is best, when a bhikkhu undertakes <I>virtue 
        dependent on requisites,</I> he should aspire to that and use them after 
        reviewing them in the way described. And this is said: 
        [45]<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The 
        truly wise disciple<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who listens to the Dhamma<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As taught by the Sublime 
        One<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Makes 
        use, after reviewing,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of alms food, and of dwelling,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And of a resting 
        place,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And 
        also of the water<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For washing dirt from robes' 
        (Sn.391).<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'So like a drop of water<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lying on leaves 
        of lotus,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bhikkhu is unsullied<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By any of these 
        matters,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By alms food, [and by 
        dwelling,]<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And by a resting place,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And also by the 
        water<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For washing dirt from robes' 
        (Sn.392).<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Since 
        aid it is and timely<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Procured from another<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The right amount he 
        reckons,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Mindful without remitting<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In chewing and in eating,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In tasting food 
        besides:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He 
        treats it as an ointment<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Applied upon a wound' ( &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
        ).<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'So like the child's flesh in the 
        desert<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the greasing for the axle,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He should eat 
        without delusion<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nutriment to keep alive' ( &nbsp; 
        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; ).<BR>130. &nbsp; And in connexion with the 
        fulfilling of this virtue dependent on requisites there should be told 
        the story of the novice Sangharakkhita the Nephew. For he made use of 
        requisites after reviewing, according as it is 
        said:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        'Seeing me eat a dish of rice<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quite cold, my Preceptor 
        observed:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        "Novice, if you are not restrained,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be careful not to burn your 
        tongue".<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 
        hearing my Preceptor's words,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I then and there felt urged to 
        act<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, 
        sitting in a single session,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I reached the goal of 
        Arahantship.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Since I am now waxed full in thought<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the full moon of the 
        Fifteenth (See M.iii,277),<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And all my cankers are 
        destroyed,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        There is no more becoming now'. [46]<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so should 
        any other man<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aspiring to end 
        suffering<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make use of all the requisites<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wisely after 
        reviewing them.<BR>&nbsp; So virtue is of four kinds as 'virtue of 
        Patimokkha restraint', and so on.<BR>131. &nbsp; 18. In the first pentad 
        in the fivefold section the meaning should be understood in accordance 
        with the virtue of those not fully admitted to the Order, and so on. For 
        this is said in the Patisambhida: <I>'(a)</I> What is virtue consisting 
        in limited purification? That of the training precepts for those not 
        fully admitted to the Order: such is virtue consisting in limited 
        purification. <I>(b)</I> What is virtue consisting in unlimited 
        purification? That of the training precepts for those fully admitted to 
        the Order: such is virtue consisting in unlimited purification. 
        <I>(c)</I> What is virtue consisting in fulfilled purification? That of 
        Magnanimous Ordinary Men devoted to profitable things, who are 
        perfecting [the course] that ends in Trainership, regardless of the 
        physical body and life, having given up [attachment to] life: such is 
        virtue of fulfilled purification. <I>(d)</I> What is virtue consisting 
        in purification not adhered to? That of the several kinds of Trainer: 
        such is virtue consisting in purification not adhered to. <I>(e)</I> 
        What is virtue consisting in tranquillized purification? That of the 
        Perfect One's disciples with cankers destroyed, of the Undeclared 
        Enlightened Ones, of the Perfect Ones, accomplished and fully 
        enlightened: such is virtue consisting in tranquillized purification' 
        (Ps.i,42-3).<BR>132. &nbsp; <I>(a)</I> Herein, the virtue of those not 
        fully admitted to the Order should be understood as <I>virtue consisting 
        in limited purification,</I> because it is limited by the number [of 
        training precepts, that is, 5 or 8 or 10].<BR>&nbsp; <I>(b)</I> That of 
        those fully admitted to the Order is [describable] 
        thus:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nine 
        thousand millions, and a hundred<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And eighty millions then as 
        well,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And 
        fifty plus a hundred thousand,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thirty-six again to swell<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The total restraint 
        disciplines:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        These rules the Enlightened One explains<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Told under heads for filling 
        out,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which 
        the Discipline restraint contains. <A name=35txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm01.html#35fn">{35}</A> <BR>So 
        although limited in number, [47] it should yet be understood as 
        <I>virtue consisting in unlimited purification,</I> since it is 
        undertaken without reserve and has no obvious limit such as gain, fame, 
        relatives, limbs or life. Like the virtue of the Elder Maha-Tissa the 
        Mango-eater who lived at Ciragumba (see &sect;122 above).<BR>133. &nbsp; For 
        that venerable One never abandoned the following Good Man's 
        Recollection,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Wealth for a sound limb's sake should be 
        renounced,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        And one who guards his life gives up his limbs;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And wealth and limbs and life, 
        each one of these,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A man gives up who practices the Dhamma',<BR>and 
        never transgressed a training precept even when his life was in the 
        balance, and in this way he reached Arahantship with that same virtue of 
        unlimited purification as his support while he was being carried on a 
        lay devotee's back. According as it is said:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nor your mother nor your 
        father<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor 
        your relatives and kin<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have done as much as this for 
        you<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because 
        you are possessed of virtue'.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, stirred with urgency, and 
        wisely<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Comprehending <A name=36txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm01.html#36fn">{36}</A> with 
        insight,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        While carried on his helper's back<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He reached the goal of 
        Arahantship.<BR>134. &nbsp; <I>(c)</I> The Magnanimous Ordinary Man's 
        virtue, which from the time of admission to the Order is devoid even of 
        the stain of a [wrong] thought because of its extreme purity, like a gem 
        of purest water, like well-refined gold, becomes the proximate cause for 
        Arahantship itself, which is why it is called <I>consisting of fulfilled 
        purification;</I> like that of the Elders Sangharakkhita the Great and 
        Sangharakkhita the Nephew.<BR>135. &nbsp; The Elder Sangharakkhita the 
        Great <I>(Maha-Sangharakkhita),</I> aged over sixty, was lying, it 
        seems, on his deathbed. The Order of Bhikkhus questioned him about 
        attainment of the supramundane state. The Elder said 'I have no 
        supramundane state'. Then the young bhikkhu who was attending on him 
        said 'Venerable sir, people have come as much as twelve leagues, 
        thinking that you have reached nibbana. It will be a disappointment for 
        many if you die as an ordinary man'. - 'Friend, thinking to see the 
        Blessed One Metteyya, I did not try for insight [48]. So help me to sit 
        up and give me the chance.' He helped the elder to sit up and went out. 
        As he went out the Elder reached Arahantship and he gave a sign by 
        snapping his fingers. The Order assembled and said to him 'Venerable 
        sir, you have done a difficult thing in achieving the supramundane state 
        in the hour of death'. - 'That was not difficult, friends. But rather I 
        will tell you what is difficult. Friends, I see no action done [by me] 
        without mindfulness and unknowingly since the time I went forth.' His 
        nephew also reached Arahantship in the same way at the age of fifty 
        years.<BR>136. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now if a man has little 
        learning<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And

        For lack of virtue and of learning.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        little learning<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet he is careful of his 
        virtue,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They praise him for his virtue, 
        so<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is as though he too had 
        learning.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        And if he is of ample learning<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet he is careless of his 
        virtue,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They 
        blame him for his virtue, so<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is as though he had no 
        learning.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if he is of ample learning<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he is 
        careful of his virtue,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They give him praise on both 
        accounts<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For virtue and as well for 
        learning.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        The Buddha's pupil of much learning<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who keeps the Law with 
        understanding - <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        &nbsp; <I>(d)</I> What should be understood as <I>virtue consisting in 
        purification not adhered to</I> is Trainers' virtue, because it is not 
        adhered to by [false] views, and ordinary men's virtue when not adhered 
        to by greed. Like the virtue of the Elder Tissa the Landowner's Son 
        <I>(Kutumbiyaputta-Tissa-thera).</I><BR>&nbsp; Wanting to become 
        established in Arahantship in dependence on such virtue, this venerable 
        one told his enemies:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I broke the bones of both my 
        legs<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To give 
        the pledge you asked from me.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am revolted and ashamed<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At death accompanied by greed. 
        [49]<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And 
        after I had thought on this,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And wisely then applied 
        insight,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        When the sun rose and shone on me,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had become an Arahant' (see 
        MA.i,233).<BR>138. &nbsp; Also there was a certain Senior Elder who was 
        very ill and unable to eat with his own hand. He was writhing smeared 
        with his own urine and excrement. Seeing him a certain young bhikkhu 
        said 'Oh, what a painful process life is!'. The senior Elder told him 
        'If I were to die now friend, I should obtain the bliss of heaven; I 
        have no doubt of that. But the bliss obtained by breaking this virtue 
        would be like the lay state obtained by disavowing the training', and he 
        added 'I shall die together with my virtue'. As he lay there, he 
        comprehended that same illness [with insight], {36} and he reached 
        Arahantship. Having done so, he pronounced these verses to the Order of 
        Bhikkhus:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I 
        am victim of a sickening disease<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That racks me with its burden of 
        cruel pain;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        As flowers in the dust burnt by the sun,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So this my corpse will soon have 
        withered up.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unbeautiful called beautiful,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unclean while 
        reckoned as if clean,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though full of ordure seeming 
        fair<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To him that cannot see it 
        clear.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So 
        out upon this ailing rotting body,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fetid and filthy, punished with 
        affliction,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Doting on which this silly generation<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has lost the way to be reborn in 
        heaven!' (Ja.ii,437).<BR>139. &nbsp; <I>(e)</I> It is the virtue of the 
        Arahants, etc., that should be understood as <I>tranquillized 
        purification,</I> because of tranquillization of all disturbance and 
        because of purifiedness.<BR>&nbsp; So it is of five kinds as 'consisting 
        in limited purification', and so on.<BR>140. &nbsp; 19. In the second 
        pentad the meaning should be understood as the abandoning, etc., of 
        killing living things, etc.; for this is said in the 
        Patisambhida:<BR>Five kinds of virtue: &nbsp; '(1) In the case of

        <A name=38txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm01.html#38fn">{38}</A> <BR>141. 
        &nbsp; And here there is no state called abandoning other than the mere 
        non-arising of the killing of living things, etc., as stated. But the 
        abandoning of a given [unprofitable state] upholds [51] a given 
        profitable state in the sense of providing a foundation for it, and 
        concentrates it by preventing wavering, so it is called 'virtue 
        <I>(sila)'</I> in the sense of composing <I>(silana),</I> reckoned as 
        upholding and concentrating as stated earlier (&sect;19).<BR>&nbsp; The other 
        four things mentioned refer to the presence <A name=39txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm01.html#39fn">{39}</A> of occurrence 
        of will as abstention from such and such, as restraint of such and such, 
        as the volition associated with both of these, and as non-transgression 
        in one who does not transgress such and such. But their meaning of 
        virtue has been explained already.<BR>&nbsp; So it is of five kinds as 
        'virtue consisting in abandoning' and so on.<BR>142. &nbsp; At this 
        point the answers to the questions, 'What is virtue? In what sense is it 
        virtue? What are its characteristic function, manifestation, and 
        proximate cause? What are the benefits of virtue? How many kinds of 
        virtue are there?', are complete.<BR>143. &nbsp; However, it was also 
        asked (vi) WHAT IS THE DEFILING OF IT? and WHAT IS THE CLEANSING OF IT? 
        We answer that virtue's tornness, etc., is its defiling, and that its 
        untornness, etc., is its cleansing. Now that tornness, etc., is 
        comprised under the breach that has gain, fame, etc., as its cause, and 
        under the seven bonds of sexuality. When a man has broken the training 
        course at the beginning or at the end in any instance of the seven 
        classes of offences, <A name=40txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm01.html#40fn">{40}</A> his virtue is 
        called torn, like a cloth that is cut at the edge. But when he has 
        broken it in the middle, it is called rent, like a cloth that is rent in 
        the middle. When he has broken it twice or thrice in succession, it is 
        called blotched, like a cow whose body is some such colour as black or 
        red with a discrepant colour appearing on the back or the belly. When he 
        has broken it [all over] at intervals, it is called mottled, like a cow 
        speckled [all over] with discrepant-coloured spots at intervals. This in 
        the first place is how there comes to be tornness with the breach that 
        has gain, etc., as its cause.<BR>144. &nbsp; And likewise with the seven 
        bonds of sexuality; for this is said by the Blessed One: 'Here, brahman, 
        some ascetic or brahman claims to lead the life of purity rightly; for 
        he does not [52] enter into actual sexual intercourse with women. Yet he 
        agrees to massage, manipulation, bathing and rubbing down by women. He 
        enjoys it, desires it and takes satisfaction in it. This is what is 
        torn, rent, blotched and mottled in one who leads the life of purity. 
        This man is said to lead a life of purity that is unclean. As one who is 
        bound by the bond of sexuality, he will not be released from birth, 
        ageing and death, ... he will not be released from suffering,<BR>145. 'I 
        say. Furthermore, brahman, ... while he does not agree to [these 
        things], yet he jokes, plays and amuses himself<BR>146. 'with women ... 
        Furthermore, brahman, ... while he does not agree to [these things], yet 
        he gazes and stares at women <BR>147. 'eye to eye ... Furthermore, 
        brahman, ... while he does not agree to [these things], yet he listens 
        to the sound of women through a wall or through a fence as they laugh or 
        talk or sing<BR>148. 'or weep ... Furthermore, brahman, ... while he 
        does not agree to [these things], yet he recalls laughs and talks and 
        <BR>149. 'games that he formerly had with women ... Furthermore, 
        brahman; ... while he does not agree to [these things], [53] yet he sees 
        a householder or a householder's son possessed of, endowed with, and 
        indulging, the five cords of sense <BR>150. 'desire ... Furthermore, 
        brahman, while he does not agree to [these things], yet he leads the 
        life of purity aspiring to some order of deities, [thinking] "Through 
        this rite (virtue) or this ritual (vow) or this asceticism I shall 
        become a [great] deity or some [lesser] deity". He enjoys it, desires 
        it, and takes satisfaction in it. This, brahman, is what is torn, rent, 
        blotched and mottled in one who leads the life of purity. This man ... 
        will not be released from suffering, I say' (A.iv,54-6).<BR>&nbsp; This 
        is how tornness, etc:, should be understood as included under the breach 
        that has gain, etc., as its cause and under the seven bonds of 
        sexuality.<BR>151. &nbsp; Untornness, however, is, accomplished by the 
        complete non-breaking of the training precepts, by making amends for 
        those broken for which amends should be made, by the absence of the 
        seven bonds of sexuality, and, as well, by the non-arising of such evil 
        things as anger, enmity, contempt, domineering, envy, avarice, deceit, 
        fraud, obduracy, presumption, pride (conceit), haughtiness, conceit 
        (vanity), and negligence (see M. Sutta 7), and by the arising of such 
        qualities as fewness of wishes, contentment, and effacement (see M. 
        Sutta 24).<BR>152. &nbsp; Virtues not broken for the purpose of gain, 
        etc., and rectified by making amends after being broken by the faults of 
        negligence, etc., and not damaged by the bonds of sexuality and by such 
        evil things as anger and enmity, are called entirely untorn, unrent, 
        unblotched, and unmottled. And those same virtues are <I>liberating</I> 
        since they bring about the state of a freeman, and <I>praised by the 
        wise</I> since it is by the wise that they are praised, and 
        <I>un-adhered-to</I> since they are not adhered to by means of craving 
        and views, and <I>conducive to concentration </I>since they conduce to 
        access concentration or to absorption concentration. That is why their 
        untornness etc., should be understood as 'cleansing' (see also Ch.VII, 
        &sect;101f.).<BR>153. &nbsp; This cleansing comes about in two ways: through 
        seeing the danger of failure in virtue, and through seeing the benefit 
        of perfected virtue. [54] Herein, the danger of failure in virtue can be 
        seen in accordance with such suttas as that beginning 'Bhikkhus, there 
        are these five dangers for the unvirtuous in the failure of virtue' 
        (A.iii,252).<BR>154. &nbsp; Furthermore, on account of his 
        unvirtuousness an unvirtuous person is displeasing to deities and human 
        beings, is uninstructable by his fellows in the life of purity, suffers 
        when unvirtuousness is censured, and is remorseful when the virtuous are 
        praised. Owing to that unvirtuousness he is as ugly as hemp cloth. 
        Contact with him is painful because those who fall in with his views are 
        brought to long-lasting suffering in the states of loss. He is worthless 
        because he causes no great fruit [to accrue] to those who give him 
        gifts. He is as hard to purify as a cesspit many years old. He is like a 
        log from a pyre (see Iti.99); for he is outside both [recluseship and 
        the lay state]. Though claiming the bhikkhu state he is no bhikkhu, so 
        he is like a donkey following a herd of cattle. He is always nervous, 
        like a man who is everyone's enemy. He is as unfit to live with as a 
        dead carcase. Though he may have the qualities of learning, etc., he is 
        as unfit for the homage of his fellows in the life of purity as a 
        charnel-ground fire is for that of brahmans. He is as incapable of 
        reaching the distinction of attainment as a blind man is of seeing a 
        visible object. He is as careless of the Good Law as a guttersnipe is of 
        a kingdom. Though he fancies he is happy, yet he suffers because he 
        reaps suffering as told in the Discourse on the Mass of Fire 
        (A.iv,128-34).<BR>155. &nbsp; Now the Blessed One has shown that when 
        the unvirtuous have their minds captured by pleasure and satisfaction in 
        the indulgence of the five cords of sense-desires, in [receiving] 
        salutation, in being honoured, etc., the result of that kamma, directly 
        visible in all ways, is very violent pain, with that [kamma] as its 
        condition, capable of producing a gush of hot blood by causing agony of 
        heart with the mere recollection of it. Here is the text:<BR>&nbsp; 
        'Bhikkhus, do you see that great mass of fire burning, blazing and 
        glowing? - Yes, venerable sir. - What do you think, bhikkhus, which is 
        better, that one [gone forth] should sit down or lie down embracing that 
        mass of fire burning, blazing and glowing, or that he should sit down or 
        lie down embracing a warrior-noble maiden or a brahman maiden or a 
        maiden of householder family, with soft, delicate hands and feet? - It 
        would be better, venerable sir, that he should sit down or lie down 
        embracing a warrior-noble maiden ... [55] It would be painful, venerable 
        sir, if he sat down or lay down embracing that great mass of fire 
        burning, blazing and glowing.<BR>156. &nbsp; 'I say to you, bhikkhus, I 
        declare to you, bhikkhus, that it would be better for one [gone forth] 
        who is unvirtuous, who is evil-natured, of unclean and suspect habits, 
        secretive of his acts,who is not an ascetic and claims to be one, who 
        does not lead the life of purity and claims to do so, who is rotten 
        within, lecherous, and full of corruption, to sit down or lie down 
        embracing that great mass of fire burning, blazing and glowing. Why is 
        that? By his doing so, bhikkhus, he might come to death or deadly 
        suffering, yet he would not on that account, on the break up of the 
        body, after death, reappear in states of loss, in any unhappy destiny, 
        in perdition, in hell. But if one who is unvirtuous, evil-natured, ... 
        and full of corruption, should sit down or lie down embracing a 
        warrior-noble maiden ... that would be long for his harm and suffering: 
        on the break up of the body, after death, he would reappear, in states 
        of loss, in an unhappy destiny, in perdition, in hell' 
        (A.iv,128-9).<BR>157. &nbsp; Having thus shown by means of the analogy 
        of the mass of fire the suffering that is bound up with women and has as 
        its condition the indulgence of the five cords of sense-desires [by the 
        unvirtuous], to the same intent he showed, by the following similes of 
        the horse-hair rope, the sharp spear, the iron sheet, the iron ball, the 
        iron bed, the iron chair, and the iron cauldron, the pain that has as 
        its condition [acceptance of] homage and reverential salutation, and the 
        use of robes, alms food, bed and chair, and dwelling [by unvirtuous 
        bhikkhus]:<BR>&nbsp; 'What do you think, bhikkhus, which is better, that 
        one should have a strong horse-hair rope twisted round both legs by a 
        strong man and tightened so that it cut through the outer skin, and 
        having cut through the outer skin it cut through the inner skin, and 
        having cut through the inner skin it cut through the flesh, and having 
        cut through the flesh it cut through the sinews and having cut through 
        the sinews it cut through the bones, and having cut through the bones it 
        remained crushing the bone-marrow - or that he should consent to the

        well set upon the road to hell.<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who else if not one destitute of

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many indeed and grave are the 
        defects<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That 
        brand a man neglectful of his virtue.<BR><BR>&nbsp; Seeing danger in the 
        failure of virtue should be understood as reviewing in such ways as 
        these. And seeing benefits in perfected virtue should be understood in 
        the opposite sense.<BR>159. &nbsp; Furthermore, 
        [58]<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His

        man,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though 
        they be few, will bear much fruit,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so the virtuous man

        nibbana,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
        state where utter peace prevails,<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        Showing full many a varied form,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So let a wise man know it 
        well<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This 
        root of all perfection's branches.<BR><BR>160. &nbsp; The mind of one 
        who understands thus, shudders at failure in virtue and reaches out 
        towards the perfecting of virtue. So virtue should be cleansed with all 
        care, seeing this danger of failure in virtue and this benefit of the 
        perfection of virtue in the way stated.<BR>161. And at this point in the 
        Path of Purification, which is shown under the headings of Virtue, 
        Concentration and Understanding by the stanza, 'When a wise man,

        for concentration is classed as both access and absorption (see 
        Ch.IV,&sect;32). Taking this stanza as the teaching for one whose vehicle is 
        insight does not imply that there is no concentration; for no insight 
        comes about without momentary concentration. And again, insight should 
        be understood as the three contemplations of impermanence, pain, and

        supramundane because the sublime goal is described; for one developing

        the path moment, and that is not mundane. But the mundane are included 
        here too because they immediately precede, since supramundane (see 
        Ch.III note 5) concentration and insight are impossible without mundane 
        concentration and insight to precede them; for without the access and 
        absorption concentration in one whose vehicle is serenity, or without 
        the momentary concentration in one whose vehicle is insight, and without

        seeing a visible object with the eye":</I> if the eye were to see the 
        visible object, then (organs) belonging to other kinds of consciousness 
        would see too; but that is not so. Why? Because the eye has no thought 
        <I>(acetanatta).</I> And then, were consciousness itself to see a 
        visible object, it would see it even behind a wall because of being 
        independent of sense-resistance <I>(appatighabhavato);</I> but that is 
        not so either because there is no seeing in all kinds of consciousness. 
        And herein, it is consciousness dependent on the eye that sees, not just 
        any kind. And that does not arise with respect to what is enclosed by 
        walls, etc., where light is excluded. But where there is no exclusion of 
        light, as in the case of a crystal or a mass of cloud, there it does 
        arise even with respect to what is enclosed by them. So it is as a basis 
        of consciousness that the eye sees.<BR>&nbsp; <I>'"When there is the 
        impingement of door and object":</I> what is intended is: when a visible 
        datum as object has come into the eye's focus. <I>"One sees":</I> one 
        looks <I>(oloketi);</I> for when the consciousness that has eye 
        sensitivity as its material support is disclosing <I>(obhasente)</I> by 
        means of the special quality of its support a visible datum as object 
        that is assisted by light <I>(aloka),</I> then it is said that a person 
        possessed of that sees the visible datum. And here the illuminating is 
        the revealing of the visible datum according to its individual essence, 
        in other words the apprehending of it experientially 
        <I>(paccakkhato).</I><BR>&nbsp; 'Here it is the <I>"sign of woman"</I> 
        because it is the cause of perceiving as "woman" all such things as the 
        shape that is grasped under the heading of the visible data 
        (materiality) invariably found in a female continuity, the 
        un-clear-cut-ness <I>(avisadata)</I> of the flesh of the breasts, the 
        beardlessness of the face, the use of cloth to bind the hair, the 
        unclear-cut stance, walk, and so on - The <I>"sign of man"</I> is in the 
        opposite sense.<BR>&nbsp; <I>'"The sign of beauty'"</I> here is the 
        aspect of woman that is the cause for the arising of lust. By the word 
        "etc." the sign of resentment <I>(patigha),</I> etc., are included, 
        which should be understood as the undesired aspect that is the cause for 
        the arising of hate. And here admittedly only covetousness and grief are 
        specified in the text but the sign of equanimity needs to be included 
        too; since there is non-restraint in the delusion that arises due to 
        overlooking, or since "forgetfulness or unknowing" is said below (&sect;57). 
        And here the "sign of equanimity" should be understood as an object that 
        is the basis for the kind of equanimity associated with unknowing 
        through overlooking it. So <I>"the sign of beauty, etc."</I> given in 
        brief thus is actually the cause of greed, hate, and delusion.<BR>&nbsp; 
        <I>'"He stops at what is merely seen":</I> according to the Sutta method 
        "The seen shall be merely seen" (Ud.8). As soon as the colour basis has 
        been apprehended by the consciousnesses of the cognitive series with 
        eye-consciousness he stops; he does not fancy any aspect of beauty, 
        etc., beyond that ... in one who fancies as beautiful, etc., the limbs 
        of the opposite sex defilements arisen with respect to them successively 
        become particularized, which is why they are called "particulars". But 
        these are simply modes of interpreting <I>(sannivesakara)</I> the kinds 
        of materiality derived from the (four) primaries that are interpreted 
        <I>(sannivittha)</I> in such and such wise; for apart from that there is 
        in the ultimate sense no such thing as a hand and so on' (Pm.40-1). See

        <I>"Perception of foulness"</I> is perception of bones; for the Elder

        of unvirtuousness happens through the mind door, and the remaining 
        restraint happens through the six doors. For the arising of 
        forgetfulness and the other three would be in the five doors since they 
        are unprofitable states opposed to mindfulness etc.; and there is no 
        arising of unvirtuousness consisting in bodily and verbal transgression 
        there because five-door impulsions do not give rise to intimation. And 
        the five kinds of nonrestraint beginning with unvirtuousness are stated
