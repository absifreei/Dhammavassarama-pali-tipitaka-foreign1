        <DIV align=left><FONT size=+1>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; [59] Now while a meditator 
        is engaged in the pursuit of virtue, he should set about undertaking the 
        ascetic practices in order to perfect those special qualities of fewness 
        of wishes, contentment, etc., by which the virtue of the kind already 
        described is cleansed. For when his virtue is thus washed clean of 
        stains by the waters of such special qualities as fewness of wishes, 
        contentment, effacement, seclusion, dispersal, energy, and modest needs, 
        it will become quite purified; and his vows will succeed as well. And 
        so, when his whole behaviour has been purified by the special quality of 
        blameless virtue and vows and he has become established in the [first] 
        three of the ancient Noble One's Heritages, he may become worthy to 
        attain to the fourth called 'delight in development' (A.ii,27). We shall 
        therefore begin the explanation of the ascetic practices.<BR><BR></FONT>

        PRACTICES]</FONT><BR></DIV><FONT size=+1><BR>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirteen 
        kinds of ascetic practices have been allowed by the Blessed One to 
        clansmen who have given up the things of the flesh and, regardless of 
        body and life, are desirous of undertaking a practice in conformity 
        [with their aim]. They are:<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; i. the refuse-rag-wearer's 
        practice, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; ii. the triple-robe-wearer's practice, 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;iii. the alms-food-eater's practice, <BR>&nbsp; iv. the 
        house-to-house-seeker's practice, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; v. the 
        one-sessioner's practice, <BR>&nbsp; vi. the bowl-food-eater's practice, 
        <BR>&nbsp;vii. the later-food-refuser's practice, <BR>viii. the 
        forest-dweller's practice;<BR>&nbsp; ix. the tree-root-dweller's 
        practice,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; x. the open-air-dweller's practice,<BR>&nbsp; 
        xi. the charnel-ground-dweller's practice,<BR>&nbsp;xii. the 
        any-bed-users' practice, <BR>xiii. the sitter's 
        practice,<BR>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Herein,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        (1) As to meaning, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) character, 
        etcetera, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) The undertaking and 
        directions,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then the grade, and 
        breach as well,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And benefits of each 
        besides,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) As to the profitable 
        triad,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5) 'Ascetic' and so on 
        distinguished,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6) And as to groups, 
        and also (7) singly,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The exposition 
        should be known. [60] <BR>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Herein, <I>as to 
        meaning,</I> in the first place.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; i. It is 'refuse 
        <I>(pamsukula)'</I> since, owing to its being found on refuse in any 
        such place as a street, a charnel ground, or a midden, it belongs, as it 
        were, to the refuse in the sense of being dumped in any one of these 
        places. Or alternatively: like refuse it gets to a vile state <I>(pamsu 
        viya kucchitabhavam ulati),</I> thus it is 'refuse <I>(pamsukula)';</I> 
        it goes to a vile state, is what is meant. The wearing of a 
        refuse-[rag], which has acquired its derivative name <A name=1txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm02.html#1fn">{1}</A> in this way, is 
        'refuse-[rag-wearing] <I>(pamsukula)'.</I> That is his habit, thus he is 
        a 'refuse-[rag-wear-]er <I>(pamsukulika)'.</I> The practice 
        <I>(anga)</I> of the refuse-[rag-wear]-er is the refuse-[rag-wear-]er's 
        practice <I>(pamsukulikanga)'.</I> It is the action that is called the 
        'practice'. Therefore it should be understood as a term for that by 
        undertaking which one becomes a refuse-[rag-wear-]er.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        ii. In the same way, he has the habit of [wearing] the triple robe 
        <I>(ti-civara)</I> - in other words, the cloak of patches, the upper 
        garment, and the inner clothing -, thus he is a 'triple-robe-[wear-]er 
        <I>(tecivarika)'.</I> His practice is called the 'triple-robe-wearer's 
        practice'.<BR>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; iii. The dropping <I>(pata)</I> of the 
        lumps <I>(pinda)</I> of material sustenance <I>(amisa),</I> called alms 
        <I>(bhikkha)</I> is 'alms food <I>(pindapata)';</I> the falling 
        <I>(nipatana)</I> into the bowl of lumps <I>(pinda)</I> given by others, 
        is what is meant. He gleans that alms food (that falling of lumps), he 
        seeks it by approaching such and such a family, thus he is called an 
        'alms-food-[eat-]er <I>(pindapatika)'.</I> Or his vow is to gather 
        <I>(patitum)</I><A name=2txt></A> <A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm02.html#2fn">{2}</A> the lump 
        <I>(pinda),</I> thus he is a 'lump-gatherer <I>(pindapatin)'.</I> To 
        'gather' is to wander for. A 'lump-gatherer <I>(pindapatin)'</I> is the 
        same as an 'alms-food-eater <I>(pindapatika)'.</I> The practice of the 
        almsfood-eater is the 'alms-food-eater's practice'.<BR>6.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        iv. It is a hiatus <I>(avakhandana)</I> that is called a 'gap 
        <I>(dana)'.</I><A name=3txt></A> <A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm02.html#3fn">{3}</A> It is removed 
        <I>(apeta)</I> from a gap, thus it is called 'gapless <I>(apadana)';</I> 
        the meaning is, it is without hiatus. It is together with <I>(saha)</I> 
        what is gapless <I>(sapadana),</I> thus it is 'with the gapless, 
        <I>(sapadana)';</I> devoid of hiatus - from house to house - is what is 
        meant. His habit is to wander on what-is-with-the-gapless, thus he is 'a 
        gaples wanderer <I>(sapadana-carin)'.</I> A gapless wanderer is the same 
        as a 'house-to-house seeker <I>(sapadana-carika)'.</I> His practice is 
        the 'house-to-house-seeker's practice'.<BR>7.&nbsp;&nbsp; v. Eating in 
        one session is: 'one-session'. He has that habit, thus he is a 
        'one-sessioner'. His practice is the 'one-sessioner's practice.' 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; vi. Alms <I>(pinda)</I> in one bowl <I>(patta)</I> 
        only, because of refusing a second vessel, is 'bowl-alms 
        <I>(patta-pinda)'.</I> Now, making 'bowl-alms <I>(patta-pinda)'</I> the 
        name for the taking of alms-food in the bowl: bowl-alms-food is his 
        habit, thus he is a 'bowl-food-eater <I>(pattapindika)'.</I> His 
        practice is the 'bowl-food-eater's practice'.<BR>8.&nbsp;&nbsp; vii. 'No 
        <I>(khalu)'</I> is a particle in the sense of refusing [61]. Food 
        <I>(bhatta)</I> obtained later by one who has shown that he is satisfied 
        is called 'later-food <I>(paccha-bhatta)'.</I> The eating of that later 
        food is 'later-food-eating'. Making 'later-food <I>(paccha-bhatta)</I> 
        the name for that later-food-eating: later-food is his habit, thus he is 
        a 'later-food-[eat-]er <I>(pacchabhattika)'.</I> Not a later-food-eater 
        is a 'no-later-food-[eat-]er <I>(khalu-pacchabhattika)',</I> [that is, a 
        'later-food-refuser'.] This is the name for one who as an undertaking 
        refuses extra food. But it is said in the commentary <A name=4txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm02.html#4fn">{4}</A> 'Khalu is a 
        certain kind of bird. When it has taken a fruit into its beak and that 
        drops, it does not eat any more. This [bhikkhu] is like that'. Thus he 
        is 'a later-food-refuser <I>(khalu-paccha-bhattika)'.</I> His practice 
        is the 'later-food-refuser's practice'.<BR>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; viii. 
        His habit is dwelling in the forest, thus he is a 'forest-dweller'. His 
        practice is the 'forest-dweller's practice'.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; ix. 
        Dwelling at the root of a tree is 'tree-root-dwelling.' He has that 
        habit, thus he is a 'tree-root-dweller'. The practice of the 
        tree-root-dweller is the 'tree-root-dweller's practice'.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        x., xi. Likewise with the open-air-dweller and the 
        charnel-ground-dweller.<BR>10.&nbsp;&nbsp; xii. Only what has been 
        distributed <I>(yad eva santhata)</I> is 'as distributed 
        <I>yatha-santhata)'.</I> This is a term for the resting place first 
        allotted thus 'This one falls to you'. He has the habit of dwelling in 
        that as distributed, thus he is an 'as-distributed user 
        <I>(yathasanthatika)',</I> [that is, an 'any-bed-user':] His practice is 
        the 'any-bed-user's pratice.'<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; xiii. He has the habit of 
        keeping to the sitting [posture when resting], refusing to lie down, 
        thus he is a 'sitter'. His practice is the 'sitter's 
        practice'.<BR>11.&nbsp;&nbsp; All these, however, are the practices 
        <I>(anga)</I> of a bhikkhu who is ascetic <I>(dhuta)</I> because he has 
        shaken off <I>(dhuta)</I> defilement by undertaking one or other of 
        them. Or the knowledge that has got the name 'ascetic <I>(dhuta)'</I> 
        because it shakes off <I>(dhunana)</I> defilement is a practice 
        <I>(anga)</I> belonging to these, thus they are 'ascetic practices 
        <I>(dhut-anga)'.</I> Or alternatively, they are ascetic <I>(dhuta)</I> 
        because they shake off <I>(niddhunana)</I> opposition, and they are 
        practices <I>(anga)</I> because they are a way 
        <I>(patipatti).</I><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; This, firstly, is how the exposition 
        should be known here 'as to meaning'.<BR>12.&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. All of them 
        have as their characteristic the volition of undertaking. For this is 
        said [in the commentary] 'He who does the undertaking is a person. That 
        whereby he does the undertaking is states of consciousness and 
        consciousness-concomitants. The volition of the act of undertaking is 
        the ascetic practice. What it rejects is the instance'. All have the 
        function of eliminating cupidity, and they manifest themselves with the 
        production of non-cupidity. For their proximate cause they have the 
        noble states consisting of fewness of wishes, and so on. [62] This is 
        how the exposition should be known <I>as to characteristic, etc., 
        here.</I><BR>13.&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards the five beginning with <I>the 
        undertaking and directions:</I> during the Blessed One's lifetime all 
        ascetic practices should be undertaken in the Blessed One's presence. 
        After his attainment of nibbana this should be done in the presence of 
        it principal disciple. When he is not available it should be done in the 
        presence of one whose cankers are destroyed, of a Non-returner, of a 
        Once-returner, of a Stream-enterer, of one who knows the three Pitakas, 
        of one who knows two of the Pitakas, of one who knows one of the 
        Pitakas, of one who knows one collection, <A name=5txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm02.html#5fn">{5}</A> of a teacher of 
        the Commentaries. When he is not available it should be done in the 
        presence of an observer of an ascetic practice. When he is not 
        available, then after one has swept out the shrine terrace they can be 
        undertaken seated in a reverential posture as though pronouncing them in 
        the Fully Enlightened One's presence. Also it is permitted to undertake 
        them by oneself.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; And here should be told the story of 
        the senior of the two brothers who were Elders at Cetiyapabbata and 
        their fewness of wishes with respect to the ascetic practices (see 
        MA.ii,140). <A name=6txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm02.html#6fn">{6}</A> 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; This, firstly, is what applies to all [the 
        practices].<BR>14.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now we shall proceed to comment on the 
        undertaking, directions, grade, breach, and benefits, of each one 
        [separately].<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; i. First, <I>the refuse-rag-wearer's 
        practice is undertaken</I> with one of these two statements: 'I refuse 
        robes given by householders' or 'I undertake the refuse-rag-wearer's 
        practice'. This, firstly, is the <I>undertaking.</I><BR>15.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        One who has done this should get a robe of one of the following kinds: 
        one from a charnel ground, one from a shop, a cloth from a street, a 
        cloth from a midden, one from a childbed, an ablution cloth, a cloth 
        from a washing place, one worn going to and returning from [the charnel 
        ground], one scorched by fire, one gnawed by cattle, one gnawed by ants, 
        one gnawed by rats, one cut at the end, one cut at the edge, one carried 
        as a flag, a robe from a shrine, an ascetic's robe, one from a 
        consecration, one produced by supernormal power, one from a highway, one 
        borne by the wind, one presented by deities, one from the sea. Taking 
        one of these robe cloths, he should tear off and throw away the weak 
        parts, and then wash the sound parts, and make up a robe. He can use it 
        after getting rid of his old robe given by 
        householders.<BR>16.&nbsp;&nbsp; Herein, <I>'one from a charnel 
        ground'</I> is one dropped on a charnel ground.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>'One 
        from a shop'</I> is one dropped at the door of a shop.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        <I>'A cloth from a street'</I> is a cloth thrown into a street from 
        inside a window by those who seek merit.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>'A cloth 
        from a midden'</I> [63] is a cloth thrown onto a place for 
        rubbish.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>'One from a childbed'</I> is a cloth thrown 
        away after wiping up the stains of childbirth with it. The mother of 
        Tissa the Minister, it seems, had the stains of childbirth wiped up with 
        a cloth worth a hundred [pieces], and thinking 'The refuse rag wearers 
        will take it', she had it thrown onto the Talaveli Road'. <A 
        name=7txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm02.html#7fn">{7}</A> Bhikkhus took 
        it for the purpose of mending worn places.<BR>17.&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>'An 
        ablution cloth'</I> is one that people who are made by devil doctors to 
        bathe themselves, including their heads, are accustomed to throw away as 
        a 'cloth of ill luck.' <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>'A cloth from a washing 
        place'</I> is rags thrown away at a washing place where bathing is 
        done.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>'One worn going to and returning from'</I> is 
        one that people throw away after they have gone to a charnel ground and 
        returned and bathed.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>'One scorched by fire'</I> is 
        one partly scorched by fire; for people throw that away.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        <I>'One gnawed by cattle,'</I> etc., are obvious; for people throw away 
        such as these too.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>'One carried as flag':</I> Those 
        who board a ship do so after hoisting a flag. It is allowable to take 
        this when they have gone out of sight. Also it is allowable, when the 
        two armies have gone away, to take a flag that has been hoisted on a 
        battlefield.<BR>18.&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>'A robe from a shrine'</I> is an 
        offering made by draping an ant-hill [in cloth].<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>'An 
        ascetic's robe'</I> is one belonging to a bhikkhu.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        <I>'One from a consecration'</I> is one thrown away at the king's 
        consecration place.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>'One produced by supernormal 
        power'</I> is a 'come-bhikkhu' robe. <A name=8txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm02.html#8fn">{8}</A> 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>'One from a highway'</I> is one dropped in the 
        middle of a road. But one dropped by the owner's negligence should be 
        taken only after waiting a while.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>'One borne by the 
        wind'</I> is one that falls a long way off, having been carried by the 
        wind. It is allowable to take it if the owners are not in 
        sight.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>'One presented by deities'</I> is one given by 
        deities like that given to the Elder Anuruddha (See 
        DhA.ii,173-4).<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>'One from the sea'</I> is one washed 
        up on dry land by the sea waves. <BR>19.&nbsp;&nbsp; One given thus 'We 
        give it to the Order' or got by those who go out for alms-cloth is not a 
        refuse-rag. And in the case of one presented by a bhikkhu, one given 
        after it has been got [at a presentation of robes by householders] at 
        the end of the Rains, or a 'resting-place robe', [that is, one 
        automatically supplied by a householder to the occupant of a certain 
        resting place,] is not a refuse-rag. It is a refuse-rag only when given 
        after not having been so obtained. And herein, that placed by the donors 
        at a bhikkhu's feet but given by that bhikkhu to the refuse-rag wearer 
        by placing it in his hand is called pure in one way. That given to a 
        bhikkhu by placing it in his hand but placed by him at the [refuse-rag 
        wearer's] feet is also pure in one way. That which is both placed at a 
        bhikkhu's feet and then given by him in the same way is pure in both 
        ways. [64] One obtained by being placed in the hand and [given by being] 
        placed in the hand too is not a strict man's robe. So a refuse-rag 
        wearer should use the robe after getting to know about the kinds of 
        refuse-rags.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; These are the <I>directions</I> for it in 
        this instance.<BR>20.&nbsp;&nbsp; The <I>grades</I> are these. There are 
        three kinds of refuse-rag wearers: the strict, the medium, and the mild. 
        Herein, one who takes it only from a charnel ground is strict. One who 
        takes one left [by someone, thinking] 'One gone forth will take it' is 
        medium. One who takes one given by being placed at his feet [by a 
        bhikkhu] is mild.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; The moment any one of these of his own 
        choice or inclination agrees to [accept] a robe given by a househblder, 
        his ascetic practice is broken. This is the <I>breach</I> in this 
        instance.<BR>21.&nbsp;&nbsp; The <I>benefits</I> are these. He actually 
        practises in conformity with the Dependence, because of the words 'The 
        Going Forth by depending on the refuse-rag robe' (Vin.i,58,96); he is 
        established in the first of the Noble One's Heritages (see A.ii,27); 
        there is no suffering due to protecting; he exists independent of 
        others; there is no fear of robbers; there is no craving connected with 
        use [of robes]; it is a requisite suitable for an ascetic; it is a 
        requisite recommended by the Blessed One thus 'valueless, easy to get, 
        and blameless' (A.ii,26); it inspires confidence; it produces the fruits 
        of fewness of wishes, etc.; the right way is cultivated; a good example 
        is set <A name=9txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm02.html#9fn">{9}</A> to later 
        generations.<BR>22.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While striving for 
        Death's army's rout<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 
        &nbsp; The ascetic clad in rag-robe 
        cloth<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Got 
        from a rubbish heap, shines 
        bright<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; As 
        mail-clad warrior in the 
        fight.<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 
        This robe the world's great teacher 
        wore,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Leaving 
        rare Kasi cloth and more; 
        -<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Who would 
        not have a robe to keep 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Of rags from 
        off a rubbish 
        heap?<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 
        Minding the words he did 
        profess<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; When 
        he went into homelessness, 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Let him to 
        wear such rags delight 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; As one in 
        seemly garb bedight.<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; This, firstly, is the 
        commentary on the undertaking, directions, grades, breach, and benefits, 
        in the case of the refuse-rag-wearer's practice.<BR>23.&nbsp;&nbsp; ii. 
        Next there is the <I>triple-robe-wearer's practice.</I> This is 
        undertaken with one of the following statements: 'I refuse a fourth 
        robe' or 'I undertake the triple-robe-wearer's practice'. 
        [65]<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; When a triple-robe wearer has got cloth for a robe, 
        he can put it by for as long as, owing to ill-health, he is unable to 
        make it up, or for as long as he does not find a helper, or lacks 
        needle, etc., and there is no fault in his putting it by. But it is not 
        allowed to put it by once it has been dyed. That is called cheating the 
        ascetic practice. These are the <I>directions</I> for 
        it.<BR>24.&nbsp;&nbsp; This, too has three <I>grades.</I> Herein, one 
        who is strict should, at the time of dyeing, first dye either the inner 
        cloth or the upper garment, and having dyed it, he should wear that 
        round the waist and dye the other. Then he can put that on over the 
        shoulder and dye the cloak of patches. But he is not allowed to wear the 
        cloak of patches round the waist. This is the duty when in an abode 
        inside a village. But it is allowable for him in the forest to wash and 
        dye two together. However, he should sit in place near [to the robes] so 
        that, if he sees anyone, he can pull a yellow cloth over himself. But 
        for the medium one there is a yellow cloth in the dyeing room for use 
        while dyeing, and it is allowable for him to wear that [as an inner 
        cloth] or to put it on [as an upper garment] in order to do the work of 
        dyeing. For the mild one it is allowable to wear, or put on, the robes 
        of bhikkhus who are in communion (i.e. not suspended, etc.) in order to 
        do the work of dyeing. A bedspread that remains where it is <A 
        name=10txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm02.html#10fn">{10}</A> is also 
        allowable for him, but he must not take it about him. And it is allowed 
        for him to use from time to time the robes of bhikkhus who are in 
        communion. It is allowed to one who wears the triple robe as an ascetic 
        practice to have a yellow shoulder-cloth too as fourth; but it must be 
        only a span wide and three hands long.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; The moment anyone 
        of these three agrees to [accept] a fourth robe, his ascetic practice is 
        broken. This is the <I>breach</I> in this instance.<BR>25.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        The <I>benefits</I> are these. The bhikkhu who is a triple-robe wearer 
        is content with the robe as a protection, for the body. Hence he goes 
        taking it with him as bird does its wings (see M.i,180); and such 
        special qualities as having few undertakings, avoidance of storage of 
        cloth, a frugal existence, the abandoning of greed for many robes, 
        living in effacement by observing moderation even in what is permitted, 
        production of the fruits of fewness of wishes, etc., are perfected. [66] 
        <BR>26.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No risk of hoarding haunts the man of 
        wit<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Who wants no 
        extra cloth for requisite;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;Using the triple robe where'er he goes, 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The pleasant relish 
        of content he knows.<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;So, would the adept wander undeterred 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;With naught else 
        but his robes, as flies the bird 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;With its' own 
        wings, then let him too rejoice 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That frugalness in 
        garments be his choice.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the commentary on the 
        undertaking, directions, grades, breach, and benefits, in the case of 
        the triple-robe-wearer's practice.<BR>27.&nbsp;&nbsp; iii. The 
        <I>alms-food-eater's practice</I> is <I>undertaken</I> with one of the 
        following statements: 'I refuse a supplementary [food] supply' or 'I 
        undertake the alms-food-eater's practice'.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now this 
        alms-food eater should not accept the following fourteen kinds of meal: 
        a meal offered to the Order, a meal offered to specified bhikkhus, an 
        invitation, a meal given by a ticket, one each half-moon day, one each 
        Uposatha day, one each first of the half-moon, a meal given for 
        visitors, a meal for travellers, a meal for the sick, a meal for 
        sick-nurses, a meal supplied to a [particular] residence, a meal given 
        in a principal house, <A name=11txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm02.html#11fn">{11}</A> a meal given 
        in turn.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; If, instead of saying 'Take a meal given to the 
        Order', [meals] are given saying 'The Order is taking alms in our house; 
        you may take alms too', it is allowable to consent. Tickets from the 
        Order that are not for actual food, <A name=12txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm02.html#12fn">{12}</A> and also a 
        meal cooked in a monastery, are allowable as well. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        These are the <I>directions</I> for it.<BR>28.&nbsp;&nbsp; This too has 
        three <I>grades.</I> Herein, one who is strict takes alms brought both 
        from before and from behind, and he gives the bowl to those who take it 
        while he stands outside a door. He also takes alms brought to the 
        refectory and given there. But he does not take alms by sitting [and 
        waiting for it to be brought later] that day. The medium one takes it as 
        well by sitting [and waiting for it to be brought later] that day; but 
        he does not consent to [its being brought] next day. The mild one 
        consents to alms [being brought] on the next day and on the day after. 
        Both these last miss the joy of an independent life. There is, perhaps, 
        a preaching on the Noble Ones' Heritages (A.ii,28) in some village. The 
        strict one says to the others 'Let us go, friends, and listen to the 
        Dhamma'. One of them says 'I have been made to sit [and wait] by a man, 
        venerable sir', and the other 'I have consented to [receive] alms 
        tomorrow, venerable sir'. So they are both losers. The other wanders for 
        alms in the morning and then he goes and savours the taste of the Dhamma 
        [67]<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; The moment any one of these three agrees to the 
        extra gain consisting of a meal given to the Order, etc., his ascetic 
        practice is broken. This is the <I>breach</I> in this 
        instance.<BR>29.&nbsp;&nbsp; The <I>benefits</I> are these. He actually 
        practices in conformity with the Dependence because of the words 'The 
        Going Forth by depending on the eating of lumps of alms food' 
        (Vin.i,58,96); he is established in the second of the Noble Ones' 
        Heritages; his existence is independent of others; it is a requisite 
        recommended by the Blessed One thus 'Valueless, easy to get, blameless' 
        (A.ii,26); idleness is eliminated; livelihood is purified; the practice 
        of the minor Training Rules [of the Patimokkha] is fulfilled; he is not 
        maintained by another; he helps others; pride is abandoned; craving for 
        tastes is checked; the training precepts about eating as a group; 
        substituting one meal [invitation for another] (See Vin. Pacittiya 33 
        and Comy.), and good behaviour, are not contravened; his life conforms 
        to [the principles of] fewness of wishes; he cultivates the right way; 
        he has compassion for later generations.<BR>30.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The 
        monk content with alms for food <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Has independent livelihood, 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; And greed in him 
        no footing finds;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 
        He is as free as the four 
        winds.<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; He never 
        need be indolent, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 
        His livelihood is innocent, 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; So let a wise man 
        not disdain <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 
        Alms-gathering for his domain.<BR><BR>Since it is 
        said:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If a bhikkhu can 
        support himself on alms<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        And live without another's 
        maintenance,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And pay no 
        heed as well to gain and fame, 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The very gods indeed 
        might envy him' (Ud.31).<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the commentary on the 
        undertaking, directions, grades, breach, and benefits, in the case of 
        the alms-food-eater's practice. <BR>31.&nbsp;&nbsp; iv. The 
        <I>house-to-house-seeker's practice</I> is <I>undertaken</I> with one of 
        the following statements: 'I refuse a greedy alms round' or 'I undertake 
        the house-to-house-seeker's practice'.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the 
        house-to-house seeker should stop at the village gate and make sure that 
        there is no danger. If there is danger in any street or village, it is 
        allowable to leave it out and wander for alms elsewhere. When there is a 
        house door or a street or a village where he [regularly] gets nothing at 
        all, he can go [past it] not counting it as the village. But wherever he 
        gets anything at all it is not allowed [subsequently] to go [past] there 
        and leave it out. This bhikkhu should enter the village early so that he 
        will be able to leave out any inconvenient place and go elsewhere. [68] 
        But if people who are giving a gift [of a meal] in a monastery or who 
        are coming along the road take his bowl and give alms food, it is 
        allowable. And as this [bhikkhu] is going along the road, he should, 
        when it is the time, wander for alms in any village he comes to and not 
        pass it by. If he gets nothing there or only a little, he should wander 
        for alms in the next village in order. These are the <I>directions</I> 
        for it.<BR>32.&nbsp;&nbsp; This too has three <I>grades.</I> Herein, one 
        who is strict does not take alms brought from before or brought from 
        behind or brought to the refectory and given there. He hands over his 
        bowl at a door, however; for in this ascetic practice there is none 
        equal to the Elder Maha Kassapa, yet an instance in which even he handed 
        over his bowl is mentioned (see Ud.29). The medium one takes what is 
        brought from before and from behind and what is brought to the 
        refectory; and he hands over his bowl at at a door. But he does not sit 
        waiting for alms. Thus he conforms to the rule of the strict alms-food 
        eater. The mild one sits waiting [for alms to be brought] that day. The 
        ascetic practice of these three is broken as soon as the greedy alms 
        round starts [by going only to the houses where good alms food is 
        given]. This is the <I>breach</I> in this instance.<BR>33.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        The <I>benefits</I> are these. He is always a stranger among families 
        and is like the moon (see S.ii,197); he abandons avarice about families; 
        he is compassionate impartially; he avoids the dangers in being 
        supported by a family; he does not delight in invitations; he does not 
        hope for [meals] to be brought; his life conforms to [the principles of] 
        fewness of wishes, and so on.<BR>34.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The monk 
        who at each house his begging plies 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Is moonlike, ever 
        new to families, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 
        Nor does he grudge to help all 
        equally,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Free from 
        the risks of 
        house-dependency.<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp; Who would the self-indulgent round 
        forsake,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; And roam 
        the world at will, the while to make 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; His downcast eyes 
        range a yoke-length before, 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Then let him 
        wisely seek from door to door.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the commentary on 
        the undertaking, directions, grades, breach, and benefits, in the case 
        of the house-to-houseseeker's practice. [69]<BR>35.&nbsp;&nbsp; v. The 
        <I>one-sessioner's practice</I> is <I>undertaken</I> with one of the 
        following statements: 'I refuse eating in several sessions' or 'I 
        undertake the one-sessioner's practice'.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; When the 
        one-sessioner sits down in the sitting hall, instead of sitting on an 
        elder's seat, he should notice which seat is likely to fall to him and 
        sit down on that. If his teacher or preceptor arrives while the meal is 
        still unfinished, it is allowable for him to get up and do the duties. 
        But the Elder Tipitaka Cula-Abhaya said 'He should either keep his seat 
        [and finish his meal] or [if he gets up he should leave the rest of] his 
        meal [in order not to break the ascetic practice]. And this is one whose 
        meal is still unfinished; therefore let him do the duties, but in that 
        case let him not eat the [rest of the] meal'. These are the 
        <I>directions.</I><BR>36.&nbsp;&nbsp; This too has three <I>grades.</I> 
        Herein, one who is strict may not take anything more than the food that 
        he has laid his hand on, whether it is little or much. And if people 
        bring him ghee, etc., thinking 'The Elder has eaten nothing', while 
        these are allowable for the purpose of medicine, they are not so for the 
        purpose of food. The medium one may take more as long as the meal in the 
        bowl is not exhausted; for he is called 'One who stops when the food is 
        finished'. The mild one may eat as long as he does not get up from his 
        seat. He is either 'One who stops with the water' because he eats until 
        he takes [water for] washing the bowl, or 'One who stops with the 
        session' because he eats until he gets up.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; The ascetic 
        practice of these three is broken at the moment when food has been eaten 
        at more than one session. This is the breach in this 
        instance.<BR>37.&nbsp;&nbsp; The <I>benefits</I> are these. He has 
        little affliction and little sickness; he has lightness, strength, and a 
        happy life; there is no contravening [rules] about food that is not what 
        is left over from a meal; craving for tastes is eliminated; his life 
        conforms to the [principles of] fewness of wishes, and so 
        on.<BR>38.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No illness due to eating shall 
        he feel<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Who gladly 
        in one session takes his 
        meal;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;No 
        longing to indulge his sense of 
        taste<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Tempts 
        him to leave his work to go to 
        waste.<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;His 
        own true happiness a monk may find 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In eating in 
        one session, pure in 
        mind.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Purity 
        and effacement wait on 
        this;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For it 
        gives reason to abide in bliss.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the commentary 
        on the undertaking, directions, grades, breach, and benefits, in the 
        case of the one-sessioner's practice. [70]<BR>39.&nbsp;&nbsp; vi. The 
        <I>bowl-food-eater's practice</I> is <I>undertaken</I> with one of the 
        following statements: 'I refuse a second vessel' or 'I undertake the 
        bowl-food-eater's practice'.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; When at the time of 
        drinking rice gruel, the bowl-food-eater gets curry that is put in a 
        dish, he can first either eat the curry or drink the rice gruel. If he 
        puts it in the rice gruel, the rice gruel becomes repulsive when a curry 
        made with cured fish, etc., is put into it. So it is allowable [to do 
        this] only in order to use it without making it repulsive. Consequently 
        this is said with reference to such curry as that. But what is 
        unrepulsive, such as honey, sugar, <A name=13txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm02.html#13fn">{13}</A> etc., should 
        pe put into it. And in taking it he should take the right amount. It is 
        allowable to take green vegetables with the hand and eat them. But 
        unless he does that they should be put into the bowl. Because a second 
        vessel has been refused it is not allowable [to use] anything else, not 
        even the leaf of a tree. These are its 
        <I>directions.</I><BR>40.&nbsp;&nbsp; This too has three <I>grades.</I> 
        Herein, for one who is strict, except at the time of eating sugarcane, 
        it is not allowed [while eating] to throw rubbish away, and it is not 
        allowed while eating to break up rice-lumps, fish, meat and cakes. [The 
        rubbish should be thrown away and the rice-lumps, etc., broken up before 
        starting to eat.] The medium one is allowed to break them up with one 
        hand while eating; and he is called a 'Hand Ascetic'. The mild one is 
        called a 'Bowl Ascetic'; anything that can be put into his bowl he is 
        allowed, while eating, to break up, [that is, rice lumps, etc.,] with 
        his hand or [such things as palm sugar, ginger, etc.,] with his 
        teeth.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; The moment any one of these three agrees to a 
        second vessel his ascetic practice is broken. This is the <I>breach</I> 
        in this instance.<BR>41.&nbsp;&nbsp; The <I>benefits</I> are these. 
        Craving for variety of tastes is eliminated; excessiveness of wishes is 
        abandoned; he sees the purpose and the [right] amount in nutriment; he 
        is not bothered with carrying saucers, etc., about; his life conforms to 
        [the principles of] fewness of wishes and so 
        on.<BR>42.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He baffles doubts that might arise 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; With extra dishes; 
        downcast eyes <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The 
        true devotedness imply <A name=l4txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm02.html#14fn">{l4}</A> 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Of one uprooting 
        gluttony.<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wearing 
        content as if 'twere part <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Of his own nature, glad at 
        heart;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None but a 
        Bowl-food Eater may <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Consume his food in such a way.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the commentary 
        on the undertaking, directions, grades, breach, and benefits, in the 
        case of the bowl-food-eater's practice. [71] <BR>43.&nbsp;&nbsp; vii. 
        The <I>later-food-refuser's practice</I> is <I>undertaken</I> with one 
        of the following statements: 'I refuse additional food' or 'I undertake 
        the later-food-refuser's practice'.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now when that 
        later-food refuser has shown that he is satisfied, he should not again 
        have the food made allowable [by having it put into his hands according 
        to the rule for bhikkhus] and eat it. These are the <I>directions</I> 
        for it.<BR>44.&nbsp;&nbsp; This too has three <I>grades.</I> Herein, 
        there is no showing that he has had enough with respect to the first 
        lump, but there is when he refuses more while that is being swallowed. 
        So when one who is strict has thus shown that he has had enough [with 
        respect to the second lump], he does not eat the second lump after 
        swallowing the first. The medium one eats also that food with respect to 
        which he has shown that he has had enough. But the mild one goes on 
        eating until he gets up from his seat.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; The moment any 
        one of these three has eaten what has been made allowable [again] after 
        he has shown that he has had enough, his ascetic practice is broken. 
        This is the <I>breach</I> in this instance. <BR>45.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
        <I>benefits</I> are these. One is far from committing an offence 
        concerned with extra food; there is no overloading of the stomach; there 
        is no keeping food back; there is no renewed search [for food]; he lives 
        in conformity with [the principles of] fewness of wishes, and so 
        on.<BR>46.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a wise man refuses 
        later-food<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; He 
        needs no extra search in weary mood, 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Nor stores 
        up food till later in the 
        day,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Nor 
        overloads his stomach in this 
        way.<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; So, 
        would the adept from such faults abstain, 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Let him 
        assume this practice for his gain, 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Praised by 
        the Blessed One, which will augment 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The special 
        qualities such as content.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the commentary on the 
        undertaking, directions, grades, breach, and benefits, in the case of 
        the later-food-refuser's practice. <BR>47.&nbsp;&nbsp; viii. The 
        <I>forest-dweller's practice</I> is <I>undertaken</I> with one of the 
        following statements: 'I refuse an abode in a village' or 'I undertake 
        the forest-dweller's practice'.<BR>48.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that forest 
        dweller must leave an abode in a village in order to meet the dawn in 
        the forest. Herein, a village abode is the village itself with its 
        precincts. A 'village' may consist of one cottage or several cottages, 
        it may be enclosed by a wall or not, have human inhabitants or not, and 
        it can also be a caravan that is inhabited for more than four months. 
        [72] The 'village precincts' cover the range of a stone thrown by a man 
        of medium stature standing between the gate-posts of a walled village, 
        if there are two gateposts, as at Anuradhapura (Cf. Vin.iii,46). The 
        Vinaya experts say that this [stone's throw] is characterized as up to 
        the place where a thrown stone falls, as, for instance, when young men 
        exercise their arms and throw stones in order to show off their 
        strength. But the Suttanta experts say that it is up to where one thrown 
        to scare crows normally falls. In the case of an unwalled village, the 
        house precinct is where the water falls when a woman standing in the 
        door of the outermost house of all throws water from a basin. Within a 
        stone's throw of the kind already described from that point is the 
        village. Within a second stone's throw is the village 
        precinct.<BR>49.&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Forest', according to the Vinaya method 
        firstly, is described thus: 'Except the village and its precincts, all 
        is forest' (Vin.iii,46). According to the Abhidhamma method it is 
        described thus: 'Having gone out beyond the boundary post, all that is 
        forest' (Vbh.251; Ps.i,176). But according to the Suttanta method its 
        characteristic is this: 'A forest abode is five hundred bow-lengths 
        distant' (Vin.iv,183). That should be defined by measuring it with a 
        strung instructor's bow from the gate-post of a walled village, or from 
        the range of the first stone's throw from an unwalled one, up to the 
        monastery wall.<BR>50.&nbsp;&nbsp; But if the monastery is not walled, 
        it is said in the Vinaya commentaries, it should be measured by making 
        the first dwelling of all the limit, or else the refectory or regular 
        meeting place or Bodhi Tree or shrine, even if that is far from a 
        dwelling [belonging to the monastery]. But in the Majjhima commentary it 
        is said that, omitting the precincts of the monastery and the village, 
        the distance to be measured is that between where the two stones fall. 
        This is the measure here.<BR>51.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the village is 
        close by and the sounds of men are audible to people in the monastery, 
        still if it is not possible to go straight to it because of rocks, 
        rivers, etc., in between, the five hundred bow-lengths can be reckoned 
        by that road even if one has to go by boat. But anyone who blocks the 
        path to the village here and there for the purpose of [lengthening it so 
        as to be able to say that he is] taking up the practice is cheating the 
        ascetic practice.<BR>52.&nbsp;&nbsp; If a forest-dwelling bhikkhu's 
        preceptor or teacher is ill and does not get what he needs in the 
        forest, [73] he should take him to a village abode and attend him there. 
        But he should leave in time to meet the dawn in a place proper for the 
        practice. If the affliction increases towards the time of dawn, he must 
        attend him and not bother about the purity of this ascetic 
        practice.<BR>These are the <I>directions.</I><BR>53.&nbsp;&nbsp; This 
        too has three <I>grades.</I> Herein, one who is strict must always meet 
        the dawn in the forest. The medium one is allowed to live in a village 
        for the four months of the Rains. And the mild one, for the winter 
        months too.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; If in the period defined any one of these 
        three goes from the forest and hears the Dhamma in a village abode, his 
        ascetic practice is not broken if he meets the dawn there nor is it 
        broken if he meets it as he is on his way back after hearing [the 
        Dhamma]. But if, when the preacher has got up, he thinks 'We shall go 
        after lying down awhile' and he meets the dawn while asleep or if of his 
        own choice he meets the dawn while in a village abode, then his ascetic 
        practice is broken. This is the <I>breach</I> in this 
        instance.<BR>54.&nbsp;&nbsp; The <I>benefits</I> are these. A 
        forest-dwelling bhikkhu who has given attention to the perception of 
        forest (see M. sutta 121) can obtain hitherto unobtained concentration, 
        or preserve that already obtained. And the Master is pleased with him, 
        according as it is said 'So, Nagita, I am pleased with that bhikkhu's 
        dwelling in the forest' (A.iii,343). And when he lives in a remote abode 
        his mind is not distracted by unsuitable visible objects, and so on. He 
        is free from anxiety; he abandons attachment to life; he enjoys the 
        taste of the bliss of seclusion, and the state of the refuse-rag wearer, 
        etc. becomes him. <BR>55.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lives secluded and 
        apart, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Remote abodes 
        delight his heart;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The 
        Saviour of the world, besides,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp; He gladdens that in groves abides. 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The hermit that in woods 
        can dwell <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Alone, may 
        gain the bliss as well <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 
        Whose savour is beyond the price 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Of royal bliss, in 
        paradise.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Wearing the 
        robe of rags he may <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Go 
        forth into the forest fray;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp; Such is his mail, for weapons too 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The other practices will 
        do.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; One so equipped can 
        be assured <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Of routing 
        Mara and his horde.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; So 
        let the forest glades delight <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp; A wise man for his dwelling's site.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the 
        commentary on the undertaking, directions, grades, breach, and benefits, 
        in the case of the forest-dweller's practice. [74] <BR>56.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        ix. The <I>tree-root-dweller's practice</I> is <I>undertaken</I> with 
        one of the following statements: 'I refuse a roof' or 'I undertake the 
        tree-root-dweller's practice'. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; The tree-root dweller 
        should avoid such trees as a tree near a frontier, a shrine tree, a gum 
        tree, a fruit tree, a bats' tree, a hollow tree, or a tree standing in 
        the middle of a monastery. He can choose a tree standing on the 
        outskirts of of a monastery. These are the 
        <I>directions.</I><BR>57.&nbsp;&nbsp; This has three <I>grades</I> too. 
        Herein, one who is strict is not allowed to have a tree that he has 
        chosen tidied up. He can move the fallen leaves with his foot while 
        dwelling there. The medium one is allowed to get it tidied up by those 
        who happen to come along. The mild one can take up residence there after 
        summoning monastery attendants and novices and getting them to clear it 
        up, level it, strew sand and make a fence round with a gate fixed in 
        it.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; On a special day a tree-root dweller should sit in 
        some concealed place elsewhere rather than there.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
        moment any one of these three makes his abode under a roof, his ascetic 
        practice is broken. The Reciters of the Anguttara say that it is broken 
        as soon as he knowingly meets the dawn under a roof. This is the 
        <I>breach</I> in this instance.<BR>58.&nbsp;&nbsp; The <I>benefits</I> 
        are these. He practices in conformity with the Dependence, because of 
        the words 'The Going Forth by depending on the root of a tree as an 
        abode' (Vin.i,58,96); it is a requisite recommended by the Blessed One 
        thus, 'Valueless, easy to get, and blameless' (A.ii,26); perception of 
        impermanence is aroused through seeing the continual alteration of young 
        leaves; avarice about abodes and love of [building] work are absent; he 
        dwells in the company of deities; he lives in conformity with [the 
        principles of] fewness of wishes, and so 
        on.<BR>59.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Blessed One praised roots of 
        trees <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; As one of 
        the Dependencies (Vin.i,58) 
        ;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Can he that loves 
        secludedness<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Find 
        such another dwelling 
        place?<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Secluded at 
        the roots of trees <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 
        And guarded well by deities 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; He lives in true 
        devotedness, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Nor 
        covets any dwelling place. [75] 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; And when the 
        tender leaves are seen <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp; Bright red at first, then turning green, 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; And then to yellow 
        as they fall<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; He 
        sheds belief once and for all 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; In permanence. 
        Tree roots have been <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp; Bequeathed by Him; secluded scene 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; No wise man will 
        disdain at all <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; For 
        contemplating [Rise and Fall].<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the commentary on 
        the undertaking, directions, grades, breach, and benefits, in the case 
        of the tree-root-dweller's practice.<BR>60.&nbsp;&nbsp; x. The 
        <I>open-air-dweller's practice</I> is <I>undertaken</I> with one of the 
        following statements: 'I refuse a roof and a tree root' or 'I undertake 
        the open-air-dweller's practice'.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; An open-air dweller is 
        allowed to enter the Uposatha-house for the purpose of hearing the 
        Dhamma or for the purpose of the Uposatha. If it rains while he is 
        inside, he can go out when the rain is over instead of going out while 
        it is still raining. He is allowed to enter the eating hall or the fire 
        room in order to do the duties, or to go under a roof in order to ask 
        elder bhikkhus in the eating hall about a meal, or when teaching and 
        taking lessons, or to take beds, chairs, etc., inside that have been 
        wrongly left outside. If he is going along a road with a requisite 
        belonging to a senior and it rains; he is allowed to go into a wayside 
        rest house. If he has nothing with him, he is not allowed to hurry in 
        order to get to a rest house; but he can go at his normal pace and enter 
        it and stay there as long as it rains. These are the <I>directions</I> 
        for it. And the same rule applies to the tree-root dweller 
        too.<BR>61.&nbsp;&nbsp; This has three <I>grades</I> too. Herein, one 
        who is strict is not allowed to live near a tree or a rock or a house. 
        He should make a robe-tent right out in the open and live in that. The 
        medium one is allowed to live near a tree or a rock or a house so long 
        as he is not covered by them. The mild one is allowed these: a [rock] 
        overhang without a drip-ledge cut in it, <A name=15txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm02.html#15fn">{15}</A> a hut of 
        branches, cloth stiffened with paste, and a tent treated as a fixture, 
        that has been left by field watchers, and so on.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
        moment anyone of these three goes under a roof or to a tree root to 
        dwell there, [76] his ascetic practice is broken. The Reciters of the 
        Anguttara say that it is broken as soon as he knowingly meets the dawn 
        there. This is the <I>breach</I> in this case.<BR>62.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
        <I>benefits</I> are these: the impediment of dwellings is severed; 
        stiffness and torpor are expelled; his conduct deserves the praise 'Like 
        deer the bhikkhus live unattached and homeless' (S.i,199); he is 
        detached; he is [free to go in] any direction; he lives in conformity 
        with [the principles of] fewness of wishes, and so 
        on.<BR>63.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The open air provides a life 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; That aids the 
        homeless bhikkhu's strife, 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Easy to get, and 
        leaves his mind <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 
        Alert as a deer, so he shall find 
        <BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Stiffness and 
        torpor brought to halt.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp; Under the star-bejewelled 
        vault<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The moon and 
        sun furnish his light,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp; And concentration his delight. 
        <BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The joy 
        seclusion's savour gives <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp; He shall discover soon who lives 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; In open air; and 
        that is why <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The 
        wise prefer the open sky.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the commentary on the 
        undertaking, directions, grades, breach, and benefits, in the case of 
        the open-air-dweller's practice.<BR>64.&nbsp;&nbsp; xi. The 
        <I>charnel-ground-dweller's practice</I> is <I>undertaken</I> with one 
        of the following statements: 'I refuse what is not a charnel ground,' or 
        'I undertake the charnel-ground-dweller's practice' .<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Now the charnel-ground dweller should not live in some place just 
        because the people who built the village have called it 'the charnel 
        ground' for it is not a charnel ground unless a dead body has been burnt 
        on it. But as soon as one has been burnt on it it becomes a charnel 
        ground. And even if it has been neglected for a dozen years, it is so 
        still.<BR>65.&nbsp;&nbsp; One who dwells there should not be the sort of 
        person who gets walks, pavilions, etc., built, has beds and chairs set 
        out and drinking and washing water kept ready, and preaches Dhamma; for 
        this ascetic practice is a momentous thing. Whoever goes to live there 
        should be diligent. And he should first inform the senior elder of the 
        Order or the king's local representative in order to prevent trouble. 
        When he walks up and down, he should do so looking at the pyre with half 
        an eye. [77] On his way to the charnel ground he should avoid the main 
        roads and take a by-path. He should define all the objects [there] while 
        it is day, so that they will not assume frightening shapes for him at 
        night. Even if non-human beings wander about screeching, he must not hit 
        them with anything. It is not allowed to miss going to the charnel 
        ground even for a single day. The Reciters of the Anguttara say that 
        after spending the middle watch in the charnel ground he is allowed to 
        leave in the last watch. He should not take such foods as sesamum flour, 
        pease pudding, fish, meat, milk, oil, sugar, etc., which are liked by 
        non-human beings. He should not enter the homes of families. <A 
        name=16txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm02.html#16fn">{16}</A> These are the 
        <I>directions</I> for it.<BR>66.&nbsp;&nbsp; This has three 
        <I>grades</I> too. Herein, one who is strict should live where there are 
        always burnings and corpses and mourning. The medium one is allowed to 
        live where there is one of these three. The mild one is allowed to live 
        in a place that possesses the bare characteristics of a charnel ground 
        already stated.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; When any one of these three makes his 
        abode in some place not a charnel ground, his ascetic practice is 
        broken. It is on the day on which he does not go to the charnel ground, 
        the Anguttara Reciters say. This is the <I>breach</I> in this 
        case.<BR>67.&nbsp;&nbsp; The <I>benefits</I> are these. He acquires 
        mindfulness of death; he lives diligently; the sign of foulness is 
        available (see Ch.VI); greed for sense desires is removed; he constantly 
        sees the body's true nature; he has a great sense of urgency; he 
        abandons vanity of health, etc.; he vanquishes fear and dread (see M. 
        Sutta 4); non-human beings respect and honour him, he lives in 
        conformity with [the principles of] fewness of wishes, and so 
        on.<BR>68.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in sleep the dweller in a 
        charnel ground shows naught <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
        Of negligence, for death is ever present to his 
        thought;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; He may be sure 
        there is no lust after sense pleasure preys 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Upon his mind, with many 
        corpses present to his gaze.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Rightly he strives because he gains a sense of urgency, 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; While in his search for 
        final peace he curbs all vanity.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Let him that feels a leaning to nibbana in his heart 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Embrace this practice 
        for it has rare virtues to impart.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the 
        commentary on the undertaking, direction, grades, breach, and benefits, 
        in the case of the charnel-ground dweller's practice. [78] 
        <BR>69.&nbsp;&nbsp; xii. The <I>any-bed-user's practice</I> is 
        <I>undertaken</I> with one of the following statements: 'I refuse greed 
        for resting places' or 'I undertake the any-bed-user's 
        practice'.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; The any-bed user should be content with 
        whatever resting place he gets thus: 'This falls to your lot'. He must 
        not make anyone else shift [from his bed]. These are the 
        <I>directions.</I><BR>70.&nbsp;&nbsp; This has three <I>grades</I> too. 
        Herein, one who is strict is not allowed to ask about the resting place 
        that has fallen to his lot 'Is it far?' or 'Is it too near?' or 'Is it 
        infested by nonhuman beings, snakes, and so on?' or 'Is it hot?' or 'Is 
        it cold?'. The medium one is allowed to ask, but not to go and inspect 
        it. The mild one is allowed to inspect it and, if he does not like it, 
        to choose another.' <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as greed for resting places 
        arises in any one of these three, his ascetic practice is broken. This 
        is the <I>breach</I> in this instance.<BR>71.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
        <I>benefits</I> are these. The advice 'He should be content with what he 
        gets' (Ja.i,476; Vin.iv,259) is carried out; he regards the welfare of 
        his fellows in the life of purity; he gives up caring about inferiority 
        and superiority; approval and disapproval are abandoned; the door is 
        closed against excessive wishes; he lives in conformity with [the 
        principles) of fewness of wishes, and so 
        on.<BR>72.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One vowed to any bed will be 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Content with what he 
        gets, and he<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Can 
        sleep in bliss without dismay 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;On nothing but a 
        spread of hay.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;He is not eager for the 
        best,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;No lowly couch 
        does he detest, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He 
        aids his young companions too 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That to the monk's 
        good life are new.<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;So for a wise man to delight 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In any kind of bed 
        is right; <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A Noble 
        One this custom loves<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;As one the Sage's Lord approves.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the 
        commentary on the undertaking, directions, grades, breach, and benefits, 
        in the case of the any-bed-user's practice.<BR>73.&nbsp;&nbsp; xiii. The 
        <I>sitter's practice</I> is <I>undertaken</I> with one of the following 
        statements: 'I refuse lying down' or 'I undertake the sitter's 
        practice'.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; The sitter can get up in any one of three 
        watches of the night and walk up and down; for lying down is the only 
        posture not allowed. These are the <I>directions.</I> [79] 
        <BR>74.&nbsp;&nbsp; This has three <I>grades</I> too. Herein, one who is 
        strict is not allowed a back-rest or cloth band or binding-strap [to 
        prevent falling while asleep]. <A name=17txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm02.html#17fn">{17}</A> The medium 
        one is allowed any one of these three. The mild one is allowed a 
        back-rest, a cloth band, a binding-strap, a cushion, 'five-limb' and a 
        'seven-limb'. A 'five-limb' is [a chair] made with [four legs and] a 
        support for the back. A 'seven-limb' is one made with [four legs,] a 
        support for the back and an [arm] support on each side. They made that, 
        it seems, for the Elder Pithabhaya (Abhaya of the Chair). The Elder 
        became a Non-returner, and then attained nibbana. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; As 
        soon as any one of these three lies down, his ascetic practice is 
        broken. This is the <I>breach</I> in this instance.<BR>75.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        The <I>benefits</I> are these. The mental shackle described thus, 'He 
        dwells indulging in the pleasure of lying prone, the pleasure of 
        lolling, the pleasure of torpor' (M.i,102), is severed; his state is 
        suitable for devotion to any meditation subject; his deportment inspires 
        confidence; his state favours the application of energy; he develops the 
        right practice.<BR>76.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The adept that can place 
        crosswise <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; His feet 
        to rest upon his thighs <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp; And sit with back erect shall make 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Foul Mara's evil 
        heart to quake.<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;No more in supine joys to 
        plump<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And wallow in 
        lethargic dump;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who 
        sits for rest and finds it good <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp; &nbsp;Shines forth in the Ascetics' 
        Wood.<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The 
        happiness and bliss it brings <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp; &nbsp;Has naught to do with worldly 
        things;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So must the 
        Sitter's Vow befit <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 
        &nbsp;The manners of a man of wit.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the 
        commentary on the undertaking, directions, grades, breach, and benefits, 
        in the case of the sitter's practice.<BR>77.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now there is 
        the commentary according to the 
        stanza:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) As to the 
        Profitable Triad, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5) 
        'Ascetic' and so on distinguished, 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6) As to groups, and 
        also (7) singly, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
        exposition should be known (see &sect;3).<BR>78.&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Herein, <I>as 
        to the Profitable Triad</I> (see Dhs.p.1): all the ascetic practices, 
        that is to say, those of trainers, ordinary men, and men whose cankers 
        have been destroyed, may be either profitable or [in the Arahant's case] 
        indeterminate. [80] No ascetic practice is unprofitable. But if someone 
        should say: There is also an unprofitable ascetic practice because of 
        the words 'One of evil wishes, a prey to wishes, becomes a forest 
        dweller' (A.iii,219), etc., he should be told: We have not said that he 
        does not live in the forest with unprofitable consciousness. Whoever has 
        his dwelling in the forest is a forest dweller; and he may be one of 
        evil wishes or of few wishes. But, as it was said above (&sect;11), they are 
        the practices <I>(anga)</I> of a bhikkhu who is ascetic <I>(dhuta)</I> 
        because he has shaken off <I>(dhuta)</I> defilement by undertaking one 
        or other of them. Or the knowledge that has got the name "ascetic 
        <I>(dhuta)"</I> because it shakes off <I>(dhunana)</I> defilement is a 
        practice <I>(anga)</I> belonging to these, thus they are "ascetic 
        practices <I>(dhutanga)".</I> Or alternatively, they are ascetic 
        <I>(dhuta)</I> because they shake off <I>(niddhunana)</I> opposition, 
        and they are practices <I>(anga)</I> because they are a way 
        <I>(patipatti)'.</I> Now no one called 'ascetic' on account of what is 
        unprofitable could have these as his practices; nor does what is 
        unprofitable shake off anything so that those things to which it 
        belonged as a practice could be called 'ascetic practices'. And what is 
        unprofitable does not both shake off cupidity for robes, etc., and 
        become the practice of the way. Consequently it was rightly said that no 
        ascetic practice is unprofitable.<BR>79.&nbsp;&nbsp; And those who hold 
        that an ascetic practice is outside the Profitable Triad <A 
        name=18txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm02.html#18fn">{18}</A> have no 
        ascetic practice as regards meaning. Owing to the shaking off of what 
        could what is non-existent be called an ascetic practice? Also there are 
        the words 'Proceeded to undertake the ascetic qualities' (Vin.iii,15), 
        and it follows <A name=19txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm02.html#19fn">{19}</A> that those 
        words are contradicted. So that should not be accepted. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        This, in the first place, is the commentary on the Profitable 
        Triad.<BR>80.&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. <I>As to 'ascetic' and so on 
        distinguished;</I> the following things should be understood, that is to 
        say, ascetic, a preacher of asceticism, ascetic states, ascetic 
        practices, and for whom the cultivation of ascetic practices is 
        suitable.<BR>81.&nbsp;&nbsp; Herein, <I>ascetic</I> means either a 
        person whose defilements are shaken off, or a state that entails shaking 
        off defilements.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>A preacher of asceticism:</I> one is 
        ascetic but not a preacher of asceticism, another is not ascetic but a 
        preacher of asceticism, another is neither ascetic nor a preacher of 
        asceticism, and another is both ascetic and a preacher of 
        asceticism.<BR>82.&nbsp;&nbsp; Herein, one who has shaken off his 
        defilements with an ascetic practice but does not advise and instruct 
        another in an ascetic practice, like the Elder Bakkula, is 'ascetic but 
        not a preacher of asceticism', according as it is said 'Now the 
        venerable Bakkula was ascetic but not a preacher of asceticism'. One who 
        [81] has not shaken off his own defilements but only advises and 
        instructs another in an ascetic practice, like the Elder Upananda is 
        'not ascetic but a preacher of asceticism', according as it is said 'Now 
        the venerable Upananda son of the Sakyans was not ascetic but a preacher 
        of asceticism'. One who has failed in both, like Laludayin, is neither 
        ascetic nor a preacher of asceticism according as it is said 'Now the 
        venerable Laludayin was neither ascetic nor a preacher of asceticism'. 
        One who has succeeded in both, like the General of the Dhamma, is 'both 
        ascetic and a preacher of asceticism', according as it is said 'Now the 
        venerable Sariputta was ascetic and a preacher of 
        asceticism'.<BR>81.&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Ascetic states:</I> the five states 
        that go with the volition of an ascetic practice, that is to say, 
        fewness of wishes, contentment, effacement, seclusion, and that specific 
        quality <A name=20txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm02.html#20fn">{20}</A> are called 
        'ascetic states' because of the words 'Depending on fewness of wishes' 
        (A.iii,219), and so on.<BR>84.&nbsp;&nbsp; Herein, <I>fewness of 
        wishes</I> and <I>contentment</I> are non-greed. <I>Effacement</I> and 
        <I>seclusion</I> belong to the two states, nongreed and non-delusion. 
        <I>That specific quality</I> is knowledge. Herein, by means of non-greed 
        a man shakes off greed for things that are forbidden. By means of 
        non-delusion he shakes off the delusion that hides the dangers in those 
        same things. And by means of non-greed he shakes off indulgence in 
        pleasure due to sense desires that occurs under the heading of using 
        what is allowed. And by means of non-delusion he shakes off indulgence 
        in self mortification that occurs under the heading of excessive 
        effacement in the ascetic practices. That is why these states should be 
        understood as 'ascetic states'. <BR>85.&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Ascetic 
        practices:</I> these should be understood as the thirteen, that is to 
        say, the refuse-rag-wearer's practice, ... the sitter's practice, which 
        have already been described as to meaning and as to characteristic, and 
        so on.<BR>86.&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>For whom the cultivation of ascetic 
        practices is suitable:</I> [they are suitable] for one of greedy 
        temperament and for one of deluded temperament. Why? Because the 
        cultivation of ascetic practices is both a difficult progress <A 
        name=21txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm02.html#21fn">{21}</A> and an 
        abiding in effacement; and greed subsides with the difficult progress, 
        while delusion is got rid of in those diligent by effacement. Or the 
        cultivation of the forest-dweller's practice and the tree-root-dweller's 
        practice here are suitable for one of hating temperament; for hate too 
        subsides in one who dwells there without coming into 
        conflict.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the commentary 'as to "ascetic" and so 
        on distinguished'. [82] <BR>87.&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. and 7. <I>As to groups 
        and also singly.</I> Now 6. <I>as to groups:</I> these ascetic practices 
        are in fact only eight, that is to say, three principal and five 
        individual practices. Herein, the three, namely, the 
        house-to-house-seeker's practice, the one-sessioner's practice, and the 
        open-air-dweller's practice, are principal practices. For one who keeps 
        the house-to-house-seeker's practice will keep the alms-food-eater's 
        practice; and the bowl-food-eater's practice and the 
        later-food-refuser's practice will be well kept by one who keeps the 
        one-sessioner's practice. And what need has one who keeps the 
        open-air-dweller's practice to keep the tree-root-dweller's practice or 
        the any-bed-user's practice? So there are these three principal 
        practices that, together with the five individual practices, that is to 
        say, the forest-dweller's practice, the refuse-rag-wearer's practice, 
        the triple-robe-wearer's practice, the sitter's practice, and the 
        charnel-ground-dweller's practice, come to eight 
        only.<BR>88.&nbsp;&nbsp; Again they come to four, that is to say, two 
        connected with robes, five connected with alms food, five connected with 
        the resting place, and one connected with energy. Herein, it is the 
        sitter's practice that is connected with energy; the rest are 
        obvious.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again they all amount to two only, since twelve 
        are dependent on requisites and one on energy. Also they are two 
        according to what is and what is not to be cultivated. For when one 
        cultivating an ascetic practice finds that his meditation subject 
        improves, he should cultivate it; but when he is cultivating one and 
        finds that his meditation subject deteriorates, he should not cultivate 
        it. But when he finds that, whether he cultivates one or not, his 
        meditation subject only improves and does not deteriorate, he should 
        cultivate them out of compassion for later generation. And when he finds 
        that, whether he cultivates them or not, his meditation subject does not 
        improve, he should still cultivate them for the sake of acquiring the 
        habit for the future. So they are of two kinds as what is and what is 
        not to be cultivated.<BR>89.&nbsp; And all are of one kind as volition. 
        For there is only one ascetic practice, namely, that conisting in the 
        volition of undertaking. Also it is said in the Commentary 'It is the 
        volition that is the ascetic practice, they say'.<BR>90.&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. 
        <I>Singly:</I> with thirteen for bhikkhus, eight for bhikkhunis, twelve 
        for novices, seven for female probationers and female novices, and two 
        for male and female lay followers, there are thus 
        forty-two.<BR>91.&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is a charnel ground in the open 
        that complies with the forest-dweller's practice, one bhikkhu is able to 
        put all the ascetic practices into effect simultaneously. But the two, 
        namely, the forest-dweller's practice and the later-food-refuser's 
        practice are forbidden to bhikkhunis by training precept. [83] And it is 
        hard for them to observe the three, namely, the open-air-dweller's 
        practice, the tree-root-dweller's practice, and the 
        charnel-ground-dweller's practice, because a bhikkhuni is not allowed to 
        live without a companion, and it is hard to find a female companion with 
        like desire for such a place, and even if available, she would not 
        escape having to live in company. This being so, the purpose of 
        cultivating the ascetic practice would scarcely be served. It is because 
        they are reduced by five owing to this inability to make use of certain 
        of them that they are to be understood as eight only for 
        bhikkhunis.<BR>92.&nbsp;&nbsp; Except for the triple-robe-wearer's 
        practice all the other twelve as stated should bc understood to be for 
        novices, and all the other seven for female probationers and female 
        novices.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; The two, namely, the one-sessioner's practice 
        and the bowl-food-eater's practice, are proper for male and female lay 
        followers to employ. In this way there are two ascetic 
        practices.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the commentary 'as to groups and also 
        singly'.<BR>93.&nbsp;&nbsp; And this is the end of the treatise on the 
        ascetic practices to be undertaken for the purpose of perfecting those 
        special qualities of fewness of wishes, contentment, etc., by means of 
        which (there comes about the cleansing of virtue as described in the 
        Path of Purification, which is shown under the three headings of virtue, 
        concentration and understanding, contained in the 
        stanza,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'When a wise man,
