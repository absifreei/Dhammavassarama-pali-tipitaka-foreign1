Chinul entered the world at a time when the sangha was in a state of crisis, in terms of external appearance as well as internal issues of doctrine. Chinul was deeply disturbed at the degree of corruption that had crept into the sangha, and for this reason sought to establish a new movement within Korean S&ocirc;n which he called the "samaadhi and praj~naa society" <a href="040.htm#b040055B9A-061116167-11303793E">定慧社</a> whose goal was to establish a new community of disciplined, pure-minded practitioners deep in the mountains. Chinul eventually accomplished this mission with the founding of the S&ocirc;nggwangsa monastery <a href="075.htm#b07504677E-053125EE3-041035BFA">松廣寺</a> at Mt. Chogye <a href="073.htm#b0730766F9-085106EAA-046005C71">曹溪山</a>. <br/>	Because of his thoroughgoing analysis and reformulation of the methodologies of S&ocirc;n study and practice, Chinul's works are seriously studied down to the present in Korean S&ocirc;n monasteries. One major issue that had fermented long in Chinese Chan and which had received special focus from Chinul, was the relationship between so-called "gradual" and "sudden" methods in practice and enlightenment. Drawing upon various Chinese treatments of this topic, most importantly those by Zongmi (<a href="040.htm#b040055B97-040085BC6">宗密</a>) and Dahui (<a href="037.htm#b037005927-061116167">大慧</a>), Chinul came up with his famous "sudden enlightenment followed by gradual practice" dictum which he outlined in a few relatively concise and accessible texts. From Dahui Chinul also incorporated the <i>kwanhwa</i> (<a href="147.htm#b1471889C0-149068A71">觀話</a>) method into his practice. This form of meditation is the main method taught in Korean S&ocirc;n down to modern times.<br/> Chinul did not undergo his enlightenment experiences as the result of the classical so-called personal "mind-to-mind transmission" between teacher and student as characterized in the S&ocirc;n school. Rather, each of his three enlightenment experiences came in connection with the contemplation of a passage in a Buddhist text. In his final articulation of his understanding of the dynamics of enlightenment, Chinul was highly influenced by the explanation of the relationship between S&ocirc;n and Kyo provided by the Tang Huayan master Li Tongxuan (<a href="075.htm#b07503674E-16207901A-095007384">李通玄</a>). Chinul's philosophical resolution of the issue of sudden/gradual enlightenment brought a deep and lasting impact on Korean Buddhism. </font><b>[Credit]</b>  <a href="../../../acmuller.htm">acm</a>(entry) <P>
