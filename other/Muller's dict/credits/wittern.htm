<P>Christian Wittern is a scholar of Chinese Chan Buddhism. He completed
his doctorate at the University of Goettingen in Oct. 1996 with the dissertation
topic "Das Yulu des Chan Buddhismus. Die Entwicklung vom 8.-11. Jahrhundert
am Beispiel des 28. Kapitels des Jingde chuandenglu (1004)", Bern , Berlin,
Frankfurt am Main 1998 (Peter Lang), and, according to the German system,
received his certification in March 1998 following the publication of the
thesis.

<P>In addition to his research on Chinese Chan, Dr. Wittern is well-known
for his work in the area of the digitization of East Asian literary resources,
most importantly East Asian Buddhist canonical texts. While working as
a research assistant at the <A HREF="http://www.iijnet.or.jp/iriz/irizhtml/zentexts/cdtexts.htm">International
Research Instititue for Zen Buddhism</A> at Hanazono University during
the early 90's he contributed much, along with Urs App, to the creation
of the ZenBase CD-ROM.

<P>He is currently employed as an Associate Researcher at the Chung-Hwa
institute in Taipei, where an important segment of his duties lie in his
capacity as Adviser to the Buddhist Studies Information Network Center
(which has been established also at Chung-Hwa) and Adviser to the <A HREF="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/cbeta">Chinese
Buddhist Electronic Text Association</A> (CBETA), overseeing the digitization
and markup of East Asian Buddhist canonical works.

<P>It is Dr. Wittern who first took the dictionary from its relatively
amorphous form and applied a basic SGML markup structure, which has served
as an indispensible basis for the further development of the work. He also
added over 3,000 Pinyin readings during the early stages when the dictionary
only had Wade-Giles information.
